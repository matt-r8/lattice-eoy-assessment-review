# CVE-2025-38352 - Linux kernel POSIX CPU timer race condition
# Affects: linux-libc-dev 6.12.43-1 (Ubuntu 24.04)
# Issue: Race condition between handle_posix_cpu_timers() and posix_cpu_timer_del()
# Primary Reason: The container is not running on a native Linux kernel. It is running within a Linux Virtual Machine (VM) managed by Podman on a macOS host. This architecture provides a critical layer of hypervisor isolation.
#
# Analysis of Impact:
# - Contained Blast Radius: A successful exploit of CVE-2025-38352, triggered from within the container, would only achieve a "container escape" into the intermediate Linux VM.
# - Limited Privilege Escalation: The attacker would gain root privileges only within the sandboxed Linux VM, not on the host macOS.
# - Host Security: The host macOS machine and its data remain protected by the hypervisor boundary. To compromise the host, an attacker would need to chain a second, much more complex VM escape vulnerability, which is outside the scope of this CVE's threat model.
#
# Conclusion: The vulnerability poses a medium risk to the isolated development environment within the VM, but a very low risk to the actual host machine. Therefore, it can be safely de-prioritized from immediate remediation, with the plan to patch the Podman VM when an update is conveniently available.
# Status: No fix available yet (affected package shows empty "Fixed Version")
# Review: Monitor Ubuntu 24.04 security updates for linux-libc-dev package
# CVE-2025-38352
