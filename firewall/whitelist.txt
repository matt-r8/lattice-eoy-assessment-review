# Firewall Whitelist Configuration - MINIMAL CUI COMPLIANT
# Format: domain:port (one entry per line)
# Comments start with #, empty lines ignored
#
# SECURITY REVIEW EVIDENCE:
# Testing shows only us-gov-east-1 endpoints are actively used.
# West-1 endpoints had 0 packets during testing but are included for failover.
#
# Total: 4 entries, all within AWS GovCloud boundary

# AWS Bedrock Runtime API (us-gov-east-1) - REQUIRED
# Evidence: 6 packets, actively used for AI inference
bedrock-runtime.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com:443

# AWS Bedrock Control Plane API (us-gov-east-1) - REQUIRED
# Evidence: 1 packet, used for API initialization
bedrock.us-gov-east-1.amazonaws.com:443

# AWS Bedrock Runtime API (us-gov-west-1) - FAILOVER
# Evidence: 0 packets during testing
# Reason for inclusion: Multi-region failover within GovCloud boundary
bedrock-runtime.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com:443

# AWS Bedrock Control Plane API (us-gov-west-1) - FAILOVER
# Evidence: 0 packets during testing
# Reason for inclusion: Multi-region failover within GovCloud boundary
bedrock.us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com:443

# ============================================================================
# OPTIMIZATION NOTE FOR FUTURE REVIEW:
# ============================================================================
# If stricter security is required and multi-region failover is not needed,
# the us-gov-west-1 endpoints (last 2 entries) can be removed.
# This would reduce the whitelist to only 2 entries.
