## Insights & Recommendations

### Key Findings

1. **Firewall 5s Impact**: 11 reviewers (7.7%) are giving 90%+ of scores as 5.0, which reduces the signal-to-noise ratio in performance differentiation.

2. **Low-Effort Reviews**: 6 reviewers (4.2%) are providing minimal text feedback (< 50 words per review) with little score variance (< 0.5 std dev), suggesting checkbox completion rather than thoughtful assessment.

3. **Score Distribution**: The company average of 4.13 suggests a generally positive review culture, with 3530 scores of 5.0 (39.8% of all scores).

4. **High-Quality Reviewers**: The top 25 reviewers (17% of total) demonstrate significantly higher engagement with 150+ words per review on average and good score differentiation.

### Recommendations for Calibration

1. **Address Firewall 5s**: Consider providing calibration training to reviewers who consistently give 90%+ scores as 5.0. They may:
   - Not understand the rating scale
   - Be conflict-averse
   - Lack context to differentiate performance

2. **Improve Low-Effort Reviews**: Encourage reviewers with minimal feedback to:
   - Provide specific examples
   - Focus on actionable feedback
   - Use the full rating scale appropriately

3. **Recognize High-Quality Reviewers**: The top 25 reviewers provide valuable, thoughtful feedback. Consider:
   - Sharing examples of high-quality reviews (anonymized)
   - Using them as calibration references
   - Acknowledging their effort

4. **Rating Scale Calibration**: With a company average of 4.13, consider whether:
   - The scale is being used as intended
   - There's grade inflation
   - Calibration sessions would help reviewers differentiate performance levels

### Data Quality Notes

- Scores of 6.0 ('Haven't had opportunity to observe') were excluded from analysis
- Text feedback analyzed includes Question 11 (rehire comment) and Question 12 (START/STOP/KEEP) combined
- 'Words per review' represents the average combined word count from Q11 + Q12 text feedback
- Reviewers with < 3 reviews were not flagged as low-effort (insufficient sample size)
- Quality score is a composite metric (0-100) based on words per review, score differentiation, review volume, and calibration
