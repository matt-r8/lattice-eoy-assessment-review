### 3. Response Rate and Confidence Analysis

**Response Rate Data Available:** 111 of 143 Risers (77.6% have response rate metadata)

**Response Rate Statistics (where available):**
- **Mean Response Rate:** 92.5%
- **Median Response Rate:** 96.0%
- **Range:** 45% to 100%
- **Mean Response Count:** 60.9 responses per Riser
- **Range:** 17 to 111 responses

**Statistical Confidence Levels:**
| Response Count | Margin of Error (±) | Confidence Level |
|----------------|---------------------|------------------|
| 5 responses | ±0.438 | LOW |
| 10 responses | ±0.310 | MEDIUM |
| 20 responses | ±0.219 | HIGH |
| 50 responses | ±0.139 | HIGH |
| 100 responses | ±0.098 | HIGH |

**Key Finding:**
- High participation (≥80%): avg score 4.112 (n=100)
- Low participation (<50%): avg score 4.100 (n=1)
- **Minimal correlation between response rate and performance score**

**"Didn't Observe" Handling:**
- Current assessments handle this well by excluding non-observers from denominator
- No evidence of artificially low response rates due to "didn't observe" responses

### 2. Strategic Initiatives (Next Quarter)
- **Tier Communication:** Roll out new tier system (S, A+, A, A-, B, C) to leadership
- **Department Calibration:** Address rating bias differences (Customer-Success harsh, Enablement easy)
- **Response Rate Improvement:** Investigate 32 Risers with missing response rate data
- **Growth Mindset Recognition:** Highlight humble high performers (Ainsilie Hibbard Δ=-1.92) as cultural exemplars

### 3. Continuous Monitoring
- **Quarterly Score Tracking:** Monitor movement between tiers
- **Self-Awareness Metrics:** Track self-peer delta patterns over time
- **Department Trends:** Ensure consistent calibration across departments
- **Response Quality:** Maintain 90%+ response rates for statistical confidence

## Statistical Validation Notes

### Why These Tier Boundaries?
- **S-Tier (4.75+):** 99th percentile - only top 2% qualify
- **A+ Tier (4.58+):** 90th percentile - top 10% of already elite talent
- **A Tier (4.25+):** 60th percentile - solid performers in upper half
- **A- Tier (3.00+):** Baseline threshold - meets Rise8's Top 10% GovTech standard
- **B Tier (2.00-3.00):** Below baseline but salvageable with development
- **C Tier (<2.00):** Critical performance issues (currently 0 Risers)

### Distribution Shape
- **Positive skew:** Median (4.170) > Mean (4.100) indicates clustering toward higher scores
- **Healthy variance:** σ=0.425 allows differentiation without excessive range compression
- **No floor effect:** Minimum (2.440) shows rating scale is properly utilized
- **No ceiling effect:** Maximum (4.910) indicates top performers can be recognized

### Comparison to Previous 110-Person Analysis
- **Mean increased:** 4.082 → 4.100 (adding 33 Risers slightly raised average)
- **3.0 baseline still valid:** 0.9% → 1.4% below threshold (minimal change)
- **S-tier threshold stable:** 4.70 → 4.75 (refined with larger dataset)
- **A+ tier threshold refined:** 4.40 → 4.58 (better captures top 10%)
