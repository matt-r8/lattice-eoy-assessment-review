# Rise8 EOY Assessment - Actionable Insights
## Priority Actions Based on Statistical Analysis

**Dataset:** 143 Risers | **Analysis Date:** 2025-12-03

---

## Immediate Actions (Next 30 Days)

### 1. Development Plans for B-Tier Risers (CRITICAL)

**Issue:** 2 Risers (1.4%) scoring below A Player baseline (3.0)

| Riser | Department | Score | Self-Delta | Status |
|-------|------------|-------|------------|--------|
| Shawn Kilroy | Customer-Success | 2.44 | Unknown | Critical - lowest performer |
| Kyle Smart | Software | 2.83 | Normal | Below baseline |

**Actions Required:**
- **Week 1:** Create 90-day development plans with clear deliverables
- **Week 2:** Assign dedicated mentors from high-performing peers
- **Weekly:** 1:1 check-ins with manager + department lead
- **Monthly:** Progress review with HR/leadership
- **After 90 days:** Assess for improvement or separation

**Success Metrics:**
- Movement to 3.0+ range (A- tier)
- Improved peer feedback quality
- Consistent delivery on commitments
- Better cultural/values alignment

---

### 2. Coaching for Overconfidence Patterns (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Issue:** Large positive self-peer deltas indicate poor self-awareness

| Riser | Department | Peer Score | Self Score | Delta | Tier |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|-------|------|
| Ryan Tuck | Software | 3.18 | 4.82 | +1.64 | A- |
| Michael Maye | Software | 3.08 | 4.45 | +1.37 | A- |
| Samuel McQueen | Software | 3.36 | 4.36 | +1.00 | A- |

**Pattern:** All three are in Software department, scoring in lower A- tier (3.00-3.50), but rate themselves significantly higher

**Actions Required:**
- **Immediate:** Schedule 1:1s to share peer feedback gap
- **Week 1:** Provide specific examples of peer concerns
- **Week 2:** Create calibration plan (pair with accurate self-assessors)
- **Ongoing:** Monthly self-assessment vs actual performance reviews
- **Goal:** Reduce delta to ±0.3 range by next assessment

**Why This Matters:**
- Overconfidence correlates with lower performance (avg delta for <3.5 performers: +0.547)
- High performers show humility (avg delta for 4.0+ performers: -0.334)
- Self-awareness is predictor of growth trajectory

---

### 3. Recognition for S-Tier Performers (RETENTION)

**Issue:** Top 3 performers (99th percentile) should be publicly recognized

| Rank | Riser | Department | Score | Current Role |
|------|-------|------------|-------|--------------|
| 1 | Andrew Knife | Platform-Cyber | 4.91 | Highest across company |
| 2 | Peter Duong | Software | 4.76 | #2 performer |
| 3 | Luke Strebel | Product-Management | 4.75 | #3 performer |

**Actions Required:**
- **Week 1:** Company-wide recognition (all-hands, Slack, newsletter)
- **Week 2:** Executive 1:1s to discuss career trajectory
- **Month 1:** Assess for portfolio lead / principal / executive track roles
- **Ongoing:** Maximum retention focus (counter any external offers immediately)
- **Quarterly:** Check-in on satisfaction, growth opportunities, compensation alignment

**Why This Matters:**
- S-tier Risers are 50x harder to replace than median performers
- External market actively recruits top talent
- Recognition reinforces company values and performance culture
- Other Risers see clear path to excellence

---

### 4. Celebrate Humble High Performers (CULTURE)

**Issue:** Growth mindset culture should be reinforced

**Most Humble High Performers (Large Negative Deltas):**
| Riser | Department | Peer Score | Self Score | Delta | Tier |
|-------|------------|------------|------------|-------|------|
| Ainsilie Hibbard | Delivery | 4.28 | 2.36 | -1.92 | A |
| Jordan Dilworth | Executive | 4.51 | 3.09 | -1.42 | A+ |
| Vanessa Ten-Kate | Marketing | 3.97 | 2.55 | -1.42 | A- |
| Octavia Leon | Software | 4.41 | 3.18 | -1.23 | A |
| Nick Mendiola | Software | 4.05 | 2.91 | -1.14 | A- |

**Actions Required:**
- **Week 1:** Share positive feedback - "Your peers see more value than you give yourself credit for"
- **Month 1:** Feature 1-2 in company communications as growth mindset exemplars
- **Ongoing:** Encourage these Risers to own their accomplishments
- **Goal:** Help them develop confidence matching their actual performance

**Why This Matters:**
- Humility is marker of high performance (39% of Risers underscore themselves)
- Growth mindset culture differentiates Rise8 from other GovTech firms
- These Risers may undervalue themselves in compensation/promotion discussions
- Modeling humility + excellence reinforces company values

---

## Strategic Initiatives (Next Quarter)

### 5. Tier System Rollout to Leadership

**Objective:** Establish data-driven performance framework

**Recommended Approach:**
1. **Leadership Review Session** (2 hours)
   - Present statistical analysis and tier definitions
   - Review tier assignments for their teams
   - Calibrate understanding of thresholds
   - Discuss compensation/promotion implications

2. **Manager Training** (1 hour)
   - How to communicate tiers to Risers
   - Tier-informed development conversations
   - Setting goals for tier advancement
   - Avoiding rigid tier labeling

3. **Documentation Package**
   - Executive Summary (high-level overview)
   - Tier System Guide (detailed reference)
   - Distribution Visualizations (data transparency)
   - Actionable Insights (this document)

**Rollout Timeline:**
- **Week 1:** Executive team review
- **Week 2:** Department lead calibration
- **Week 3:** Manager training
- **Week 4:** Begin Riser 1:1s with performance discussions

---

### 6. Department Calibration (Address Rating Bias)

**Issue:** Significant variance in department mean scores suggests rating culture differences

**Easiest Raters (Higher Scores):**
- Operations: 4.56 (n=1, sample size concern)
- Enablement: 4.47 (50% in top 10%, may be lenient or genuinely high-performing)
- Delivery: 4.37 (n=2, small sample)

**Harshest Raters (Lower Scores):**
- PeopleOps: 3.66 (n=1, sample size concern)
- Customer-Success: 3.74 (high variance σ=1.14, inconsistent ratings)
- IT: 3.80 (n=2, small sample)

**Actions Required:**
- **Month 1:** Review rating patterns with department leads
- **Month 2:** Calibration sessions across departments
- **Ongoing:** Share score distributions to increase awareness
- **Goal:** Reduce department mean variance by 20% in next assessment

**Important:** Do NOT adjust thresholds by department. Maintain company-wide standard (3.0 = A Player baseline).

**Why This Matters:**
- Inconsistent rating cultures disadvantage Risers in harsh-rating departments
- Compensation/promotion decisions should be equitable across departments
- Rating calibration improves fairness and transparency

---

### 7. Response Rate Investigation

**Issue:** 32 Risers (22%) missing response rate metadata

**Departments Affected:**
- Customer-Success: 3/3 (100%)
- Executive: 9/9 (100%)
- Marketing: 6/6 (100%)
- Delivery: 2/2 (100%)
- Enablement: 4/6 (67%)
- Design: 1/16 (6%)

**Hypothesis:** Assessment format variation or data collection issue

**Actions Required:**
- **Week 1:** Review assessment data collection process
- **Week 2:** Identify root cause (format, tool, process)
- **Month 1:** Implement fix for next assessment cycle
- **Validation:** Test with small group before full rollout

**Why This Matters:**
- Response rate affects statistical confidence
- Missing data reduces analysis completeness
- Future analyses need consistent data format

---

### 8. Self-Awareness Development Program

**Objective:** Help all Risers develop accurate self-assessment skills

**Target Audiences:**
1. **Overconfident (Δ > 0.5):** 12 Risers - Reality calibration needed
2. **Very Humble (Δ < -1.0):** 8 Risers - Confidence building needed
3. **Accurate (Δ ±0.1):** 10 Risers - Showcase as exemplars

**Program Components:**
1. **Self-Assessment Workshop** (quarterly)
   - How to objectively evaluate your performance
   - Using peer feedback for self-calibration
   - Growth mindset vs overconfidence

2. **Peer Feedback Training**
   - Giving specific, actionable feedback
   - Rating calibration exercises
   - Understanding rating scale meanings

3. **Manager Coaching**
   - Helping Risers interpret peer feedback
   - Addressing self-awareness gaps
   - Setting realistic growth goals

**Success Metrics:**
- Reduce % with Δ > 1.0 from 2.1% to <1.0%
- Increase % with accurate self-assessment (-0.3 to 0.3) from 41.3% to 50%+
- Maintain culture of humility (mean delta negative)

---

## Continuous Monitoring

### 9. Quarterly Tier Movement Tracking

**Objective:** Monitor performance trajectories over time

**Tracking Metrics:**
- **Tier Changes:** Who moved up/down and why?
- **Score Changes:** Trend analysis (improving, declining, stable)
- **Department Trends:** Systematic patterns across teams
- **Self-Awareness:** Delta changes over time

**Report Cadence:**
- **Quarterly:** Tier movement summary
- **Semi-Annual:** Deep-dive analysis
- **Annual:** Year-over-year comparison

**Actions Based on Trends:**
- **Declining Scores:** Early intervention before reaching B-tier
- **Stagnant Scores:** Development opportunities to spark growth
- **Improving Scores:** Recognize and reward progress
- **Department Trends:** Address systemic issues (tooling, leadership, etc.)

---

### 10. Response Quality Maintenance

**Current State:** Excellent (92.5% mean response rate)

**Objective:** Maintain high participation for statistical validity

**Actions:**
- **Pre-Assessment:** Communicate importance of participation
- **During Assessment:** Reminder nudges for non-responders
- **Post-Assessment:** Thank participants, share how feedback is used
- **Quarterly:** Review response rate trends

**Target Metrics:**
- **Response Rate:** Maintain 90%+ mean
- **Response Count:** Maintain 50+ mean responses per Riser
- **"Didn't Observe" Rate:** Track and minimize (currently well-handled)

**Why This Matters:**
- Higher response rates = higher statistical confidence
- 50+ responses gives ±0.139 margin of error (high confidence)
- <20 responses gives ±0.219 margin of error (medium confidence)

## Communication Guidelines

### DO:
- ✓ Share scores and what they mean (percentiles, context)
- ✓ Focus on behaviors, outcomes, and growth
- ✓ Use tier data to inform decisions (promotion, comp, projects)
- ✓ Celebrate high performers publicly
- ✓ Provide clear development paths for all tiers

### DON'T:
- ✗ Label people as "B-tier Riser" or "A- tier employee"
- ✗ Use tiers as primary feedback mechanism (too reductive)
- ✗ Force tier distributions (let performance determine tiers)
- ✗ Compare individuals publicly (share aggregate data only)
- ✗ Make tier the sole basis for decisions (consider context)

### Sample Language:

**For High Performers:**
> "Your peer average of 4.76 places you in the top 1% of the company. You're recognized as an exceptional performer driving transformational impact. Let's discuss how to continue growing and what roles might be next for you."

**For Solid Performers:**
> "Your score of 4.42 puts you in the solid performer range (top 40% of company). You're consistently delivering quality outcomes. Here are areas where you can grow toward exceptional performance (4.58+ range)."

**For Baseline Performers:**
> "Your score of 3.85 shows you're meeting our A Player baseline standards. Let's discuss how to move toward strong performer range (4.25+) through these specific actions."

**For Below Baseline:**
> "Your score of 2.83 is below our A Player baseline (3.0). We need to create a clear development plan to help you improve. Here are the specific areas we need to focus on."

- **A- Tier:** Consider after sustained performance improvement
- **B Tier:** Not promotion-eligible until improvement to A- tier

### Compensation Adjustments
- **S-Tier:** Market + 20-30% (top of band or above)
- **A+ Tier:** Market + 10-20% (upper band)
- **A Tier:** Market + 0-10% (mid-upper band)
- **A- Tier:** Market ±5% (mid band)
- **B Tier:** Hold until improvement, then adjust

### Project Assignments
- **S-Tier:** Highest-impact, most visible, most complex
- **A+ Tier:** Critical projects, leadership opportunities
- **A Tier:** Important projects, growth stretch assignments
- **A- Tier:** Standard projects, development opportunities
- **B Tier:** Lower-risk projects with close oversight

### Mentorship Pairing
- **Best Mentors:** A+ and upper A tier with accurate self-awareness (Δ ±0.3)
- **Avoid:** Overconfident Risers as mentors (poor role modeling)
- **Pairings:** Match B/lower A- with patient, growth-oriented A+/A mentors
