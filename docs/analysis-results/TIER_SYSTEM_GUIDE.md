## Department-Specific Considerations

### Tier Distribution by Department

**High-Performing Departments (mean ≥4.30):**
- Operations (4.56) - Small sample (n=1)
- Enablement (4.47) - 50% in S+A+ tier
- Delivery (4.37) - Small sample (n=2)
- Executive (4.34) - 11% in S+A+ tier

**Average-Performing Departments (mean 4.00-4.20):**
- Platform-Cyber (4.16) - Largest group, 21% in S+A+ tier
- Growth (4.16) - Small sample (n=2)
- Product-Management (4.13) - 14% in S+A+ tier
- Design (4.07) - 6% in S+A+ tier

**Lower-Performing Departments (mean <4.00):**
- Marketing (3.98)
- Software (3.96) - Has both S-tier and B-tier
- IT (3.80) - Small sample (n=2)
- Customer-Success (3.74) - High variance (σ=1.14)
- PeopleOps (3.66) - Small sample (n=1)

**Important:** Do NOT adjust thresholds by department. These differences reflect:
1. Rating culture variations (some departments rate harsher)
2. Small sample sizes in some departments
3. Natural performance variation

All Risers evaluated against same company-wide standard (3.0 = A Player baseline).

## Self-Awareness Patterns by Tier

### Delta (Self - Peer) Analysis

| Tier | Typical Delta | Pattern | Coaching Focus |
|------|---------------|---------|----------------|
| S (4.75+) | -0.485 | Very humble | Channel humility into leadership |
| A+ (4.58-4.75) | -0.450 | Humble | Encourage confidence in abilities |
| A (4.25-4.58) | -0.300 | Slightly humble | Good self-awareness |
| A- (3.00-4.25) | -0.100 | Realistic | Maintain accurate self-view |
| B (2.00-3.00) | +0.785 | Overconfident | Reality calibration critical |

**Key Insight:** Inverse correlation between performance and self-rating
- High performers undervalue themselves (growth mindset, humility)
- Low performers overvalue themselves (Dunning-Kruger effect)

**Coaching Implications:**
- **S/A+ Risers:** Encourage to own their exceptional performance
- **B Risers:** Help calibrate self-perception to match peer feedback

## Usage Guidelines

### For Leadership/Management

**Tier-Based Actions:**
- **S-Tier:** Maximum retention, portfolio leads, company-wide visibility
- **A+ Tier:** Promotion consideration, critical projects, mentorship
- **A Tier:** Growth opportunities, standard development, reliable assignments
- **A- Tier:** Clear growth paths, development support, monitor trajectory
- **B Tier:** 90-day plans, intensive support, separation consideration

**Communication Approach:**
- Use tiers as **internal calibration tool**, not labels
- Focus on **behaviors and outcomes**, not tier names
- Emphasize **growth trajectory** over static tier placement
- Celebrate **improvement** as much as absolute performance

### For Performance Reviews

**Tier System Integration:**
1. Start with peer average score (objective data)
2. Map to appropriate tier (data-driven placement)
3. Discuss strengths and growth areas (qualitative feedback)
4. Set SMART goals for next period (forward-looking)
5. Determine compensation/promotion actions (tier-informed decisions)

**Avoid:**
- "You're a B-tier Riser" (label-focused)
- Tier as primary feedback mechanism (lacks nuance)
- Rigid tier boundaries without context (humans aren't numbers)

**Preferred:**
- "Your peer average of 4.42 puts you in the solid performer range"
- "You're tracking toward exceptional performance (4.58+ range)"
- "Let's discuss how to move from baseline (3.0+) to strong performer (4.25+)"

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: Can someone move between tiers during the year?**
A: Yes. Tiers are based on assessment data at specific points. Performance can improve or decline.

**Q: What if someone is right at a boundary (e.g., 4.57 vs 4.58)?**
A: Use holistic judgment. Score is one input. Consider trajectory, context, and qualitative feedback.

**Q: Should we tell Risers their tier?**
A: Communicate **score and what it means**, not tier label. Focus on performance, not category.

**Q: What if a department has no top-tier performers?**
A: Normal for small departments. Focus on developing high-potential Risers, not forcing distribution.

**Q: Is 3.0 threshold too low given mean is 4.10?**
A: No. 3.0 is **baseline** (minimum standard). Mean being higher shows company exceeds baseline.

**Q: Should we force a distribution (e.g., only 10% in A+)?**
A: No. Let natural performance distribution determine tiers. Current 8.4% in A+ is healthy.

**Q: What about new hires with limited peer feedback?**
A: Tier system applies to Risers with sufficient tenure (typically 6+ months). New hires assessed differently.
