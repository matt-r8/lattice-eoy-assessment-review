## Insights & Observations

### Strengths
1. **High Average Participation**: With an average of 6.04 reviews received per employee, the company demonstrates strong peer feedback culture.

2. **Consistent Distribution**: The median of 6 reviews aligns closely with the average, indicating a well-balanced distribution without extreme outliers.

3. **Strong Core Contributors**: 17 reviewers (11.5%) wrote 10 or more reviews, showing leadership in the feedback process.

4. **Broad Participation**: 148 unique reviewers contributed feedback, indicating company-wide engagement rather than reliance on a small group.

### Areas for Attention

1. **Minimal Participation Cases**: 4 employees received zero peer reviews. This may indicate:
   - New hires who joined after the review cycle began
   - Employees on leave or with limited team interaction
   - Roles with minimal cross-functional collaboration

2. **Review Distribution Variance**: While most employees received 5-7 reviews, there's notable variance (0-13 range), suggesting:
   - Different team sizes and structures
   - Varying levels of cross-functional collaboration
   - Possible differences in role visibility

3. **Participation Gap**: 26.4% of reviewers wrote 4 or fewer reviews, which may indicate:
   - New employees still building relationships
   - Limited exposure to other team members' work
   - Opportunity for more structured review assignments

## Methodology

**Data Source**: Assessment markdown files in `assessments/` directory
**Pattern Matched**: `## [Name] (Peer)` headers in each assessment file
**Files Analyzed**: 147 employee assessment files (excluding synthesized reports)
**Calculation Method**: Direct count of peer review section headers

---

## Recommendations

1. **Follow-up on Zero Review Cases**: Investigate the 4 employees who received no peer reviews to ensure they receive feedback through alternative channels.

2. **Recognition for Top Contributors**: Acknowledge the 17 reviewers who wrote 10+ reviews for their exceptional contribution to the feedback culture.

3. **Encourage Broader Participation**: Consider providing guidance or support to the 26.4% of reviewers who wrote limited reviews to increase their participation in future cycles.

4. **Maintain Current Standards**: The 6-review average appears to be working well and should be maintained as a target for future cycles.
