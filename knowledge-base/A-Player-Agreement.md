# **`“A Player” Agreement`**

# **`Introduction`**

Congratulations, and thank you for joining our mission\! Changing the culture of the largest bureaucracies in the world is not a hero’s task—it takes a dream team aligned on the biggest outcomes. For our entire organization to be a dream team, we need A Players in every position, either hired or grown internally. We also need great coaches who ensure every player on the field excels at their position and the whole is bigger than the sum of its parts.

- Rick Crossland, “The A Player”

On a dream team, it is important that you push yourself to be the best teammate you can be and care intensely about your teammates’ success as well. As you join this team, it’s important for you to understand very clearly how we expect all members to conduct themselves to achieve our mission. 

We break down an “A Player” into who they are, (beliefs, traits, skills) and the behaviors they exhibit. You can learn more in the How We Behave section of the Rise8 Operating Model (Employee Handbook). Once signed, a copy of this agreement will be added to your employee profile.

# **`Beliefs`**

Every aspect of our dream team—the people, the culture, and every decision we make—can be traced back to our core values. **We keep it real / about outcomes in production / achieved through grit and a growth mindset / with no unnecessary rules.** In order to play on this team, **we agree to be bold, to do the right thing, to do what works, to do what is required, and to always be kind**. **We agree to follow the five principles to optimize for learning.** These are described further in our [manifesto](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14sBUNQYZLH-nL202VWIcVH8zrKWJzELi/view?usp=drive_link), which underpins our beliefs and ensures they are well understood and can be translated to action.

One specific belief that we want to highlight given the disruption and polarization it is causing in our industry is this: **AI makes A Players even better, and in a Red Queen race like we are in, staying an A Player means becoming an AI master.** We also have a strong opinion, that is strongly held: **If AI isn’t giving you the outputs you want, it is more *likely* that you lack the skill than the AI lacks the capability.** Some of the brightest marketers, salespeople, engineers, designers, PMs, etc. that have gone all in on mastering this new skill have come away saying it’s a multiplier. The skeptics all seem to have one thing in common, they didn’t invest in the skills required to use the tool, and then blame the tool. Proving that AI can’t do a thing means mastering the skills and then demonstrating that it still isn’t generating good outputs.

# **`Traits`**

Teaming is at the core of how we work at Rise8.  Every Riser is responsible for how they team and their team’s health.  Each team will need to work in different ways depending on the engagement and its team members, but there are many traits we expect to see for highly functioning teams and team members. They can all be traced back to the four virtues described in the manifesto—Wisdom, Courage, Justice, and Temperance. Examples include, but are not limited to:

* Growth-minded and strong desire for growing through feedback  
* Clear, honest, and transparent communicator that clearly sets expectations  
* Self-aware, reflective, and introspective  
* Deliberate and goal-oriented  
* Inquisitive and an analytical evidence-based thinker  
* Results-driven and pragmatic, focused on achieving measurable outcomes  
* Ethical, trustworthy, and thoughtful  
* Collaborative and team-focused  
* Driven, tenacious, and resilient  
* Proactive, accountable, and responsible

# **`Standard Delivery Team Ceremonies and Artifacts`**

The following recurring ceremonies and critical artifacts have been proven to foster high performing delivery teams at Rise. PMs take responsibility for ensuring these are established and maintained through collaboration with customers, stakeholders, users and cross-functional partners.

| Recurring Ceremonies | Critical Artifacts |
| ----- | ----- |
| Daily Stand Ups**\*** | Assumptions/Risks Tracker |
| Backlog Grooming | Stakeholder Interview Insights |

***\***it’s recommended that the PM owns coordination, but facilitation should be shared amongst teammates.*

# **`Results`**

To advance our purpose, vision and mission at Rise8, we want to build dream teams, full of A Players, in every role. Tied directly to how we assess end of year performance assessments, we set aspirational goals for every Riser to deliver results for client missions and company contributions.

* Our **purpose** is to make the world work better and we en**vision** a future where fewer bad things happen because of bad software. 

* To get there, our **mission** is to become the best company in the world at enabling large enterprises to 1\) continuously deliver 2\) valuable software that 3\) users love.

* Results demonstrating 1, 2, and 3 should be the basis of your quarterly and annual goals, as determined by your department.

* Valuable (2) implies user outcomes (in prod) and resultant mission impact.

## **`Client Mission Results`**

Client mission results are the measurable impacts to their mission driven by the outcomes we create with software in production. As a counter balance, we measure customer and team health. Therefore if you are on a delivery team, you are accountable for three things: (1) measurable outcomes and impacts in production, (2) healthy customers and (3) a healthy team (if you’re not on a delivery team, you’re accountable for enabling and supporting these). 

*Every* individual is responsible for driving account health and sharing back lessons learned and best practices through various internal forums.  For example, our recurring Prod Hall forum is where we share and celebrate Outcomes in Prod, as well as review key account health indicators such as Rise8 Brand Promises (e.g., establishing continuous delivery, measuring first outcome in prod within 180 days of contract start date, and weekly deployments within the first year of contract start date). 

## **`Company Business Results`**

If we are going to accomplish our mission, every member of our A Team needs to contribute to our company initiatives to help Rise8 scale, mature and generate new business growth opportunities. There is no shortage of opportunities to contribute to the company, so make it known what you are passionate about, talk to your colleagues, practice leads, and leadership team to learn about opportunities to contribute and grow new skills, and confirm what measurable results will look like.

# **`A Note on Professional Development Activities`**

We measure results. Professional development is a means, not an ends. We don’t measure personal development activities, just the results you produce. That said, culturally, we believe strongly that individual development is the only way to increase personal contribution to results. As a learning-obsessed organization, we expect you to develop yourself and look for opportunities to develop others.  Not developing yourself and your teammates is a red flag. Seek a coach and/or act as a coach, and look for opportunities to share your unique skillsets and coach others.  Demonstrate thought/practice leadership

# **`Conclusion`**

As a teammate at Rise8, we want you to always remember that you represent and reflect our brand. Our brand purpose is to *make the world work better*. We can always do better, so strive to make something better each day. Create *mission impact* through *outcomes in production,* and ensure that *fewer bad things happen because of bad software*. We provide elite software delivery and operations for the most critical missions. We are putting our trust in you to do your best work so that, as a team, we can continuously deliver valuable software that those mission users love.

We believe that you have the beliefs, traits, skills, and behaviors outlined here. To be a dream team, though, *every* A Player has to live our values and principles, grow their character, and continuously improve their skills in their position on the field. This agreement is a multi-way street. When you sign it, you do so knowing that all your teammates have made the same commitment. You also do so knowing you have leadership’s commitment to ensure Rise8 stays true to what we have described here. Now we ask for yours.

***I understand what it means to be an A Player, and I commit to being an A Player as defined by this agreement.***
