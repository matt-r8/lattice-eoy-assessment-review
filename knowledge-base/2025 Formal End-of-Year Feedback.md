# **Formal End of Year Feedback**

At Rise8, we aim to assemble high-performing teams, placing A Players in every position. Risers should consistently receive feedback to fuel their career growth—from production, customers, peers, coaches, and leadership alike.  It’s a constant process.  Seek it out proactively. Offer it generously.  Feedback is a dynamic, collaborative effort for everyone involved.

To cultivate an environment of continuous improvement, we employ a formal semi-annual performance review process.  Our goal is to identify concrete actions to improve and ensure we’re delivering on our brand promises to customers. 

## **End of Year Feedback Goals**

* Comprehensive, with clear expectations and simple directions.   
* A complement to existing informal feedback methods and reinforcing habits.   
* Review growth from Mid-Year Feedback.  
* Assess Riser performance and inform them where they’re excelling.   
* Uncover areas of improvement and opportunities for growth. 

## **Who participates in the feedback?** 

All Risers will participate in the end-of-year feedback regardless of their start date.

## **Considerations**

### **Peer Reviewer Nominations**

In Lattice, Risers will nominate all members of their team. If less than five, nominate up to five peers who can speak to your impact on other efforts (e.g. internal Rise8 initiatives, coaching engagements, or their Practice Lead / Manager).

See the **External Feedback** section on how to include feedback from teammates external to Rise8.

### **Peer Nomination Overrides** 

Leadership will review Peer Nominations and potentially override nomination selections. Reasons for doing so may include: not nominating all teammates, not nominating enough teammates, one Riser having too many nominations, etc.

### **Peer Review** 

Peers will provide valuable insights into your performance, work habits, and collaboration   
skills. We encourage honest and constructive feedback from colleagues who have worked   
closely with you throughout the year. Peer reviews offer diverse perspectives and help identify unknowns that may not be apparent from self-introspection alone. 

Whether it's praise or a call to action for improvement, Risers are expected to be honest,   
open, and direct with the feedback they provide. This feedback is meant to be   
comprehensive and lean at the same time. Risers should expect to spend anywhere from 10 to no more than 30 minutes per peer feedback. However, the goal is to provide valuable   
feedback describing how a Riser’s efforts translated to positive or negative outcomes. 

**WARNING – not being honest, open, and direct has consequences. First, it reflects on you as an A Player yourself. Second, it leads to lower team health and performance, which impacts your ability to demonstrate A Player performance in the next cycle. Thirdly, if you haven’t shared this with your peer, why not? Look for opportunities to share this feedback at all times. Finally, it allows B and C Players to not only survive, but thrive, creating teams and a company that can’t fulfill our promise and that you don’t want to work for. The main thing that determines career advancement and compensation at Rise8 are the points on the scoreboard, not the conversation in the locker room after the game. To put it plainly: this feedback impacts advancement and compensation very little compared to outcomes, impact, and happy customers. If you don’t give good feedback, though, you won’t achieve any of that, now or in the future. Explicit or implicit agreements to give soft feedback as a team will backfire completely, both in the short and long term. Don’t do it.**

### **External Feedback**

While non-Rise8 individuals or peers cannot provide feedback via the Review feature, Lattice can send a feedback request to an external user using the [Feedback](https://rise8.latticehq.com/?feedbackIntent=request) feature. The Review Cycle will show all feedback received during that review period. 

### **Self Review** 

Risers can reflect on and narrate their top performance and accomplishments over the year. Risers should take time to assess strengths, areas for improvement, and any challenges they have encountered. Risers will document their key wins throughout the year and the impact those wins have had on Rise8, our customers, and Risers around them. This self-reflection will be a foundation for coaching conversations and further professional development. Risers are expected to be honest, open, and upfront with their self-introspection. A wide disconnect between self and peer assessments can be a red flag. 

Once all peer and self-assessments are complete, your packet will be sent to you. Risers will write a one-pager using the 4P drumbeat format to communicate their **performance** (KPIs), **progress** (accomplishments), **plans** (goals and actions you will take next year), and **problems** identified that you are working/will work through. You can expect this exercise to take between 45 and 90 minutes. 

### **Leadership Review** 

Leadership will review your one-pager and other inputs (scoreboards, assessment packet, direct outreach) to build a comprehensive picture of your performance. For Delivery team members, additional sources of input Leadership may review are Customer Success reports, Team survey feedback, Client Liaison input, Bonusly, and Outcomes in Production. 

### **Compensation Adjustments** 

Compensation adjustments will be communicated directly to Risers alongside a short narrative. If you seek additional information, you can schedule a 1:1 with the appropriate member of the leadership team. For everyone outside of delivery, that is your Director. Delivery is undergoing changes in Q4, but for this EOY please consult: Jeff Wills, Matt Pacione, Brian Jennings, or Rob Monroe.

## **Feedback**

Risers should use the A Player definition as the basis for their responses.  An A Player is an employee in the top 10% of their profession on an industry-wide basis for the salary paid. Refer to the [A Player overview](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17Km4OqblUtK9Ei6w6VW5qatfdjR91fO5/view?usp=sharing) for more information. Consider their level as a proxy for salary paid.
