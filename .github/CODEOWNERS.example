# CODEOWNERS.example - Template for Code Ownership and Required Reviewers
#
# IMPORTANT: This is a TEMPLATE file for CMMC Level 2 compliance
#
# To use this file:
# 1. Rename this file from CODEOWNERS.example to CODEOWNERS
# 2. Replace @your-org/security-or-dev-team with your actual GitHub team or user handles
# 3. Commit the file to enforce required reviews on security-critical files
#
# WHY THIS MATTERS FOR CMMC LEVEL 2:
# CMMC Level 2 requires "Access Control" (AC.L2-3.001) which includes:
# - Limiting system access to authorized users and processes
# - Controlling information flow between systems and system components
#
# The firewall whitelist and configuration directly control network access boundaries.
# Requiring code review on these files helps ensure:
# - No unauthorized domains are added to the whitelist
# - Changes are reviewed for security implications
# - An audit trail exists for compliance verification
#
# See: https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/about-code-owners

# Firewall Configuration - Requires Security/Dev Team Review
# All changes to the firewall whitelist must be reviewed to ensure CMMC Level 2
# compliance and prevent unauthorized data exfiltration
/firewall/whitelist.txt @your-org/security-or-dev-team

# Firewall Initialization Script - Requires Security/Dev Team Review
# Changes to firewall logic require review for security implications
/firewall/init-firewall.sh @your-org/security-or-dev-team

# Docker Compose Configuration - Requires Security/Dev Team Review
# Container configuration affects security boundaries and network isolation
/.devcontainer/docker-compose.firewall.yml @your-org/security-or-dev-team
