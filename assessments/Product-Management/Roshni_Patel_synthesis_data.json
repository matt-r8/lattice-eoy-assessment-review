  "enps_comments": "**Minh Nguyen:**\nYour performance as a Senior PM is outstanding. You excel at product discovery, defining problems, and laying out clear outcomes that directly set our team up for success; your Value Stream Mapping artifact is consistently the best across the team. You manage stakeholders masterfully: always respectful, yet highly effective at pushing back and steering them toward the right direction, which is especially important with our new stakeholder. You are an exceptional team advocate, consistently considering engineering capacity, and you create a relaxed environment where no one ever feels rushed to work on tasks.\n\n**Edwin Karaya:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Roshni. She is an exceptional PM who has built deep trust with mission stakeholders and consistently brings clarity back to the engineering team. She communicates openly, anticipates risks, handles shifting requirements without losing momentum, and creates a supportive, transparent team environment. Her calm, steady presence and strong facilitation skills make her invaluable to the mission and the team.\n\n**Hannah Cheng:**\nI am grateful for the opportunity to work with Roshni on Mission Workup. I feel that our working styles complement each other perfectly, allowing us to fill gaps and support one another effectively. Roshni is an exceptional active listener, not just with stakeholders, but with every member of the team. She creates a culture of inclusion by encouraging teammates to contribute across domains. She excels at gaining alignment, providing necessary clarity on immediate next steps while maintaining enough flexibility to handle unexpected situations.
