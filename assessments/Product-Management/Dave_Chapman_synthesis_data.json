  "enps_comments": "**Mary Pollin:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Dave for his role on my team. Dave aligns strongly with the definition of an A Player as he is highly productive, delivers on commitments, and drives critical outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nHe consistently demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem space and the overall vision for Tracer, often thinking about the big picture to ensure long-term success. His ability to ask hard questions and consider concerns others missed is a critical A Player trait, as A Players bring solutions, not problems.\n\n\n\n\nDave's performance following his leave, where he quickly adapted to a significant pivot and picked up right where he left off, speaks to his high accountabilityand resilience. He immediately added value, demonstrating the kind of productivity and focused alignment that an organization needs.\n\n**Alexandra Brierton:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Dave. He brings deep technical curiosity, strong alignment with our mission and importance of outcomes, and a genuine passion for building a product that delivers real value to users for Rise8. He shows up prepared for portfolio conversations, represents the team well in leadership settings, and is a kind, collaborative partner in day-to-day work. I also appreciate how much he cares about doing things the right way, whether that\u2019s digging into STIGs, ODPs, and OSCAL, or advocating for risks that need to be surfaced. Working with him is grounding, thoughtful, and human, and he contributes meaningfully to the culture of our team.\n\n**Michael Silverman:**\nDave is an outstanding Product Manager who excels in navigating an incredibly complex domain. He successfully steers the team through the intricacies of RMF, constantly deepening his subject matter expertise to refine Tracer's long-term vision.\n\n\n\n\nA major turning point this year was his leadership in shifting us toward a modular control structure. By enhancing our hybrid model to better align with OSCAL\u2014specifically focusing on statements as the pivotal data point\u2014he fundamentally improved both our internal mental model and the resulting user experience. He also brought critical clarity to our user segmentation, defining how distinct personas (Implementors vs. Assessors) and frameworks (DoD vs. FedRAMP) require unique workflows. Culturally, Dave is inclusive and collaborative, consistently looking to the engineering team to help drive prioritization and shape the roadmap.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\nDave is an outstanding natural leader in the team. He is always cool under pressure, takes on every difficult and unpleasant task with grace, and is constantly striving to understand our domain incredibly deeply. He regularly seeks out input from his teammates and our stakeholders to ensure his understanding and ideas are aligned with the overall product and domain. Dave is also just an absolutely pleasant person to work with. Overall, he is an incredible asset to the team and a joy to work with personally.\n\n**Bryon Kroger:**\nBefore I give any comments I just want to emphasize that my context on your performance is quite limited, so you should give the most weight to feedback from your peers. I mainly see the output/outcome with no observation of activities. With that, I want to focus on two big areas for improvement, and both are related. \n\n\n\n\n1) Be bold Dave Chapman! You aren't being bold enough. We need to really go after this space. The compound startup that becomes the Salesforce/Rippling of the compliance platform space. We still haven't even bitten off eMASS, and that's just the table stakes for being a viable \"platform\" in this domain. I gave you and the team that as part of the vision for mission impact, but... \n2) I don't feel like we are working backwards from mission impact, or even from eMASS takeover. It feels like we are thinking small... which makes the value prop small... which makes interest in adoption small... which keeps the budget/team small. Think big! Work backwards from total domination of this space. And then get the heck after it!\n\n**Paul Nieto:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Dave because he is a very skilled product manager: he excels at rigorous investigation and effectively navigating the tension between internal team needs and external stakeholder demands. Dave is dedicated to mastering the domain, I've been impressed at his dedication to research and understanding new domain challenges as they arise. He leverages AI to deepen his understanding of compliance requirements and translates that research into clear, well scoped tickets. He is transparent with the team and stakeholders, and he does not back down from defending Tracer when external teams attempt to deprioritize our goals or when misunderstandings arise. Furthermore, he fosters a collaborative environment by trusting engineering expertise and seeking feedback on his own learnings. He is tenacious in his drive to get answers but remains flexible enough to work through reasoning with others to find the best path forward. Dave is the perfect kind of manager to have for a domain as a difficult as the one that Tracer is tackling and his skills are suited for ensuring this team excels; Dave is a key asset to Tracer.\n\n**Justin Reynolds:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Dave for any role in the organization. He is an incredibly passionate product manager who demonstrates more grit than 95% of industry professionals at his level. He is always willing to put in the work and \"do what's required\" to deeply understand the complex RMF domain, overcome obstacles, and ensure the entire team is aligned. I'm confident he would excel at any task, and he is definitely someone who should be in forward-facing opportunities at Rise8.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Mary Pollin:**\n- Continue to leverage and share your deep domain knowledge. This knowledge is a critical asset that helps the entire team ask the right questions and maintain alignment on complex integration challenges. Continue to use this expertise to drive mission/business impact.\n- Maintain the high level of adaptability demonstrated during the strategic pivot. Your ability to re-engage quickly and move forward in the new direction, even when previous work required adjustment, shows strong Grit and a Growth Mindset.\n- Prioritize identifying key risk areas based on long-term domain expertise. Leverage the deep knowledge of the domain to proactively identify and communicate long-term risks or opportunities in the new strategic direction, acting as the Devil's Advocate but only by bringing solutions.\n\n**Alexandra Brierton:**\n**Start:**\nI\u2019d love to see you keep leaning into bias for action earlier, especially when things feel ambiguous. I\u2019ve noticed improvement from past feedback and a perfect example was your recent Slack post in the forge-delivery-general channel about the ASD STIG work. You reached out, got fast responses, and we avoided wasting time going down a wrong path. That kind of proactiveness makes a huge difference.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop:**\nLet\u2019s stop getting pulled into future hypotheticals that aren\u2019t actionable yet. I know a lot of your concern comes from wanting Tracer to fully deliver on our core value prop of inheritance/traceability. But as long as we\u2019re aligned with stakeholders, we can only move as fast as the resources and constraints of the project we\u2019re on allow. Trusting that we're capable to handle those bigger pieces when the timing and support are right will help us stay focused on what we can move forward today.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep:**\nKeep bringing your deep technical curiosity, thoughtful preparation, and genuine care for building a meaningful product. I really value how kind and collaborative you are, how much thought you put into understanding the domain, and how well you represent the team in stakeholder/external team conversations. You make it easy to work together, and that\u2019s something I appreciate a lot!\n\n**Michael Silverman:**\nStart: Dave should start defining the goal and desired output for every discussion before we dive in. This applies to scheduled meetings, but especially to the 'off-the-cuff' ones. When a casual chat turns into a long debate, I want Dave to pause us and ask, 'What exactly do we need to solve right now?' Setting that direction early prevents us from spinning our wheels and helps the team focus.\n\n\n\n\nKeep: Dave should keep getting into the weeds of the domain. I really appreciate that he actually takes the time to understand the messy details\u2014like how OSCAL and statements work\u2014instead of just staying high-level. It makes it way easier for us engineers to build the right thing when our PM actually understands the data structure.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\n- Keep thinking critically about the metrics that matter for Tracer; I love that you challenge and try to understand the metrics that we're using, ensuring that we're focused on the right things that can actually be measured.\n- Start/Keep leaning into rapidly testing hypotheses; sometimes I worry you're a little too cautious when sometimes the team simply needs to take a leap and test something out to learn. Don't be afraid to guide us down a path with uncertainties, even when we know it might mean backtracking a bit when we discover that we made a bad bet.\n\n**Bryon Kroger:**\nI think I covered it above... maybe one stop/don't... one iRise really got in your head. As I was typing the message above I kept thinking about how it might make you feel. Don't let the last year or this assessment get in your head. If I didn't think you could do the job, I wouldn't give you the feedback and tell you to go crush it. You can do this. Go crush it!\n\n**Paul Nieto:**\nStart: Dave is excellent at presenting his learnings, but I would recommend he start being slightly more explicit about the specific agenda for meetings regarding domain findings. This is a very minor adjustment, but setting that context ahead of time would help the team better prepare for the depth of information he shares.\n\n\n\n\nStop: There is nothing that comes to mind that Dave should stop doing; his performance and interaction with the team have been excellent.\n\n\n\n\nContinue: Dave should continue his rigorous investigation and defense of Tracer. He navigates tension with external teams very well and he manages the Tracer team very well, both interpersonally and also in tasks like ticket scoping and product direction/research.\n\n**Justin Reynolds:**\nKeep displaying your high-level of passion, grit, and investment. You definitely are somebody who is willing to do whatever is required. I saw a lot of investment in Mary and Tracer equally as you set her up for success professionally before taking your parental PTO; that was awesome.\n\n\n\n\nI recommend working on communication pacing. You're super passionate, sometimes that can feel like a monologue. It can be challenging for collaborators to stay locked-in during a long explanation, especially during an already draining meeting. I'd suggest starting to find spots to pause and invite dialogue. Sometimes it can feel like the output of the monologue was a vocalization to learn by teaching others, more than checking if others internalized the content.\n",
