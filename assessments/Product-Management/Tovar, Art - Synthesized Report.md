1. I successfully drove and supported **2 user outcomes** and **3 supporting outcomes** this year, all focused on advancing our mission to continuously deliver valuable software users love. My top three outcome were:
   1. **Secure Messaging Access Restored:** Collaborated directly with the upstream My HealtheVet team to identify a critical API bug that caused over 48,000 errors. The resultant fix eliminated all these errors, restoring a critical healthcare communication channel for Veterans and directly contributing toward the OMTM of reducing VA errors by 50%. This incident helped shift the team mindset from reactive to proactive, demonstrating **Grit** and **Growth Mindset**.
   2. **Mitigating Security Risk via On-Premise CyberChef:** Led the deployment and accreditation of an on-premise version of CyberChef on the secure Unified Platform. The **Outcome** is that users now process sensitive mission data exclusively with the secure, on-prem tool, mitigating a significant security risk for the customer (demonstrating **Do The Right Thing**).
   3. **Restored Accurate Performance Baseline for Appointments Service:** Investigated and deployed a code change to the appointments service that correctly reclassified an expected empty data response from a critical 500 error to a success (204). **Quantitatively**, this specific error count was reduced from ~22,000 to 0 in 7 days, eliminating "false positive" alerts. This re-established an accurate performance baseline, directly improving our 'Reduce Errors' OKR and restoring a trustworthy view of service health for VA stakeholders, demonstrating the principle to **Keep it Real**.
2. **Strategic Leadership and Realignment in a Vacuum (Watchtower Team):** I immediately took the reins of the **Watchtower team's** Product Manager function, a moment that required swift, decisive action. I redefined the team's strategic direction by collaborating with the team and stakeholders to build a value stream map, an impact map, and a new roadmap. This strategic focus led to the successful delivery of **one User Outcome and one Supporting Outcome** soon after. **Customer satisfaction increased significantly**, leading the stakeholder to request sharing our success with their leadership, demonstrating my **Grit** and capacity to **Do What is Required** for mission continuity.
3. **Accelerating Value Delivery Post-Team Consolidation (Unified Platform):** Faced with the challenge of combining two teams into the **Unified Platform** team and a looming contract end, I quickly organized the team to identify and prioritize the top customer problems. This rapid, focused strategy enabled the successful delivery of **one User Outcome and two Supporting Outcomes** before the contract concluded, demonstrating consistent results and high-agency execution in a dynamic environment.
