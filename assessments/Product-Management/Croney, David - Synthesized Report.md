(6 months




- Setting up the FORGE portfolio teams with a strategy, roadmap and goals broken down with a short, medium and long term vision.
Maintained and advocated for the focus on driving towards an outcome in production despite this not being the primary goal of the client and pushback from different sources internally. Impact on Rise8 - This sets up Rise8 to be able to continue to pursue outcomes in prod for FORGE despite the setbacks in account setups that are still needed to get to production




- Coaching the FORGE cyber team:
From - A team with no effective planning, goals or backlog to milestones aligned with FORGE priorities.
To - Agile ceremonies running weekly - standup, IPM, retro. Epics and milestones now aligned with the portfolio priorities. Prioritized phases of cyber work aligned to the production outcomes goals and beyond. Cyber team now has a leader enabled in PM principles to carry this work forward.
Impact on Rise8 - This has accelerated the ability for Rise8 and the FORGE program to deliver outcomes in production as soon as possible by getting the necessary cyber work planned and executed in as short a time as possible.
