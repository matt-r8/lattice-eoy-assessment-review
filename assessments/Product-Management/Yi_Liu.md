### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> **1. Be Bold: Team Leader**
Rationale: I had the courage to speak truth to stakeholders and refuse scope creep in the final week. I successfully aligned the team to share in this risk, driving their performance.




**2. Do The Right Thing: Solid Performer**
Rationale: I demonstrated integrity to the mission and the team. This is a baseline strong rating; to move higher would require evidence of ethical leadership that transformed the wider culture.




**3. Do What Works: Best in Grade**
Rationale: I quantified impact (a reduction in user interactions) and worked backward to define the strategy (prioritizing AI precision and ordering). This set the direction for the win.




**4. Do What is Required: Team Leader**
Rationale: I did the hard thing: prioritizing the swipe to order feature over AI/ML improvements to ensure the core mission was met. I focused on activities that drove outcomes, not just output volume.




**5. Always Be Kind: Solid Performer**
Rationale: I am professional and caring, but I withhold direct feedback to preserve camaraderie. A Team Leader/Best in Grade uses feedback to accelerate growth, even when uncomfortable.




**6. Keep it Real: Team Leader**
Rationale: I was transparent with stakeholders about risks and trade-offs with sequencing markers and drawing sections to detect buildings, taking ownership of the result rather than promising the impossible.




**7. Outcomes in Production: Solid Performer**
Rationale: I achieved the a solid outcome for the competition. However, because it did not deploy to live field usage, I cannot rate this as "Best in Grade" production impact.




**8. Grit: Team Leader**
Rationale: I demonstrated sustained passion and rigor over an intense 8-week sprint, directly driving the team’s quality and eventual success.




**9. Growth Mindset: Team Leader**
Rationale: I leveraged a deep understanding of AI/ML to solve a novel problem. While my personal growth regarding feedback is a work in progress, my technical adaptability drove the team forward.




**10. No Unnecessary Rules: Best in Grade** 
Rationale: I exercised high agency by letting the team intentionally break a standard data science rule (overfitting) because it served the mission best. I prioritized the outcome over the process.




**11. Enthusiastically Rehired: Strongly Agreed**
Rationale: I deliver wins. The combination of high agency, strategic clarity, and the ability to ship a winning product under time constraints makes me an indispensable asset.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> START committing to delivering any necessary feedback within 24 hours of observing the behavior. Normalize feedback as routine instead of scary. Helping me move from Solid Performer to Team Leader in Always Be Kind.




STOP delaying feedback under the guise of protecting camraderie. It creates outcome debt. A team can handle the truth; what they can't handle is failing because nobody told them they were off-track.




KEEP defining the winning metric and condition early and bending rules to achieve it. My superpower is cutting through the noise to "Do What Works". I will not blindly follow standards just because I'm on a new team or environment.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. **Delivered a 70% Reduction in Cognitive Load for TAK Operators**
Led the product strategy for the TAK competition, driving a focus on outcomes over outputs. By prioritizing precision and streamlining sequencing of markers, I led the team to build a solution that reduced the number of required user interactions by 70% compared to the legacy workflow, achieving 90% precision on the key imagery provided by the Government. Directly supporting the mission where we create a future where fewer bad things happen because of bad software. By reducing the cognitive burden on the operator, I minimized the risk of human error in a high-stress environment, proving that softtwre can be both powerful and simple.
2. **Protected the Value Stream by Realigning Stakeholders**
In the final week of the competition, I boldly pushed back against stakeholder requests for new features to focus on the Swipe to Sequence logic. I identified that this specific feature was not where we needed to be and was the critical path to tactical utility (direction and distance) and successfully rallied the team to ship this instead of other nice-to-have features like capturing user corrections to improve our model or exporting in GeoPDF.
3. **Exercised High Agency to Prioritize Mission Success Over Standard Process**
Supported engineers in their controversial but strategic decision to overfit the AI model to government satellite imagery, violating standard data science norms to maximize performance within the constraints of the competition. I validated the risk by checking performance against non Government Furnished Imagery and proceeded because it was the best path to winning.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Yi is very dedicated and rigorous which is both his greatest asset and weakness. When Yi is on course, he gets far down the right path; when Yi is off course, he gets far but not down the right path. I applaud the zeal, but this can cause unintentional team friction and misalignment, especially coupled with Yi's tendency to go completely heads down for a period of time. I say this because fundamentally Yi has the makings of a standout PM and small adjustments can really unlock Yi's potential.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - communicating more with team




Keep - Grit and resolve, you put in the time and effort and it really pays off




Stop - waiting until you have finished the entire first draft of a product/deliverable before showing it to the team (feels like flipping the table)

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Working with Yi on the TAK 9-week prototype, I saw his strong organizational skill and ability to persevere, moving fast towards milestones. Yi helped the team to organize strong, specific delivery milestones and ensured we were all marching to the same beat. Yi was able to retain enough structure while allowing the team lots of trust and flexibility to just "go" and get things researched, figured out, and created.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: encouraging a fast, organized pace, more definition and validation early on. Keep collaborating on features with the team and pairing with design to flesh out the storytelling and meaning of the solution.




Stop: not really a "stop" but I would just encourage Yi to stop the team when necessary to come together and collaborate/problem solve more, when needed, so that we have alignment and discussion even if things seem to be moving fast/time is tight.




Start: even more focus on outcome and metrics, measuring and telling a story of behavior/outcome change and mission impact. While we accomplished this (and a lot more) with TAK, it would have been cleaner to finish the measurement and  refine story telling around it.

> Yi is the perfect example of how a PM should be, he is on top of everything, asks the right questions, and tracks you down when you need to be tracked down. He is a joy to work with and I can trust in his abilities when working with him, never need to worry if things are being kept together.
