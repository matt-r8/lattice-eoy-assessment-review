**Comment**:
> Ron has been an absolute pleasure to work with and a tremendous leader and teammate. 




I've been lucky enough to have Ron as a PM on two separate efforts, and in both, he has done a tremendous job managing priorities, leading the team, and coordinating with stakeholders. 




He is personable, smart, and honest. He approaches problems with an open mindset and makes sure everyone is on the same page. He prioritizes learning, and has shown the ability to learn complex subjects and domains in a short amount of time. 




I would love to see Ron in a leadership role as I think he is that good.

**Comment**:
> I would love to see Ron continue to chip away at gaining more technical prowess. While he is a cATO SME, I think there's a complimentary technical layer that could be added on to that knowledge.




Ron should keep being an outstanding teammate and leader.

> It's only been 2 months working with Ron, but overall he's been a pleasure to work with. He was dropped into a pretty difficult domain and has taken it upon himself to learn it (cATO SME as some would say).

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Ron is really great at getting the team thinking about goals with each interaction with have with our users and stakeholders. He's ambitious with them too which really drives the team to moving quickly while also making sure it doesn't hinder the quality specifically with the preliminary mid point contextual report. He's been great at leaning on others when necessary, and I admire that he's not afraid to let people know when he doesn't know a thing. He's built a great relationship with our PO where verbally said "he trust us" in a really short amount of time. 




Over the next few months I think it's going to be crucial for us to continue to figure out how to best integrate with the organization, make sure we're not operating in a silo, and we're utilizing the entire team (6 engineers is a lot!)

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Ron because he successfully navigates the ambiguity of high-complexity engagements. On ACE, he has adapted quickly to the unique challenge of merging a Discovery & Framing engagement with a technical cATO implementation. He embodies **Do What Works** by helping the team pivot from theoretical goals to scoping a tractable 'thin slice' and identifying the 'durable thing' that will provide leverage for future security work. Additionally, his ability to **Always Be Kind** is a superpower in this environment; he has been exceptionally patient with stakeholders who are under intense pressure, preserving critical relationships. He is a strong interviewer and a steady partner in discovery, proving he can move fast and stay flexible even when the next step isn't immediately clear.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **STOP**




- **Stop the "stream of consciousness" communication style.** When you use filler words (um, uh) or change course mid-sentence, it undercuts your authority. You are doing high-value work; take the time to pause, process, and formulate a complete thought before speaking. We can wait for you to process—it is better to be clear than fast.
- **Stop "over-including" data in our artifacts.** Our *Preliminary Contextual Inquiry Report* is already dense with findings from over 15 interviews. While the data is valid, including every bullet point risks dissuading leadership from digesting the risk-informed roadmap we are trying to build. Don't let the most salient points get lost in the noise; be sharper in your editorial choices to ensure our durable thing narrative lands.
- **Stop missing the political subtext by assuming the best.** While your kindness is a strength, it can be a liability in this environment. We are navigating complex political sensitivities, such as the Deputy CISO’s concerns about duplication or the pressure on the Platform team. You need to see through the weeds of these tensions to protect the team’s focus, even if stakeholders can't bluntly articulate the issues themselves.




### **START**




- **Start developing a linear strategic structure.** As we move toward solution framing, the team needs a clear structure to execute against. Use your product opinion to distill our manifold discovery findings into a simplified "win/win/win" narrative that all client stakeholders can easily support.
- **Start leveraging Rise8 leadership to handle blockers.** You don't have to solve every organizational dysfunction alone. Be bold**** and recognize when to pull Rise8 leadership into the conversation to end-run client dysfunctions. This will free you up to focus on the thin slice execution.
- **Start confidently delegating.** I trust your instincts, but I want to see you ask for help more confidently. Ask your teammates to take the lead on specific pieces of the work so you can focus on the higher-level strategy.




### **KEEP**




- **Keep scoping down to the "Durable Thing."** Your willingness to take the "Rise8 way" and scope it down to a tractable, thin horizontal slice in service of continuous authorization is exactly the right instinct. This focus is critical to moving us from a research phase to building the automated security pipeline.
- **Keep up the operational hygiene and interviewing partnership.** Your diligence in collecting and sorting artifacts during our discovery phase has been excellent. I really value taking turns with you during interviews and building that fluency together.
- **Keep being a kind, steady presence.** You have been exceptionally patient with stakeholders who we know are under pressure. Your ability to give kind, actionable feedback and Always Be Kind**** makes you a joy to work with.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Ron as a Senior Product Manager because Ron consistently models high standards of performance and integrity. Ron is great in his core responsibilities as a product manager, delivering transformative results while operating with accountability. He ensure successful execution in production and takes on the tasks of gathering data for submitting outcomes in prod and supporting outcomes and clearly communicating the impacts of those outcomes to stakeholders. Ron models transparency and clarity when communicating priorities and risks to stakeholders and providing feedback.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep acting as the indispensable owner of outcomes. Your ability to transparently communicate risks and priorities and provide a voice to the impact of solutions is essential. You also have a keen ability to identify supporting outcomes, making sure that no team accomplishment goes unrecognized. Keep shielding teams from unnecessary busy work so teams can maintain focus on high-leverage deliverables. Stop viewing yourself as just a facilitator for the team. Given your demonstrated strategic impact, high integrity, and influence on teams, you should recognize your leadership capacity and impact. Start providing proactive, unsolicited feedback to teammates. Your feedback is incredibly valuable when requested, and your insights would be even more impactful when shared proactively.

**Comment**:
> Ron is an incredible PM. I’ve really enjoyed working with him, and I’m genuinely sad that I won’t be working with him moving forward. He was excellent at writing outcomes, driving toward them, and clearly representing the work our team delivered. He was also strong at setting priorities and refining our roadmap. Ron consistently sought feedback—both from the team and from our tenants—to understand how we were doing and where we could improve. He was very user-focused, frequently gathering input on the tools we built and refining the golden path based on that feedback.
