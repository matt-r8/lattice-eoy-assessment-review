  "accomplishments": "1. Met deadline for OPSCAP reporting software - In May of this year, we NEEDED to have a OPSCAP tool in Palantir software ready for the squadrons that did not already have one. This is because of an order from a general that went out stating that it was mandatory to start reporting OPSCAP digitally. We met this deadline and had over 400 users using the application within the month. These squadrons were able to fulfill their duty of submitting digital OPSCAP reports which has allowed commanders to now organize this information more efficiently leading to more efficient and accurate decisions for battle readiness and resource allocation within Space Force.\n2. Required multi-select feature - We made a feature on OSIT (our tool) that was very important for meeting strict OPSCAP reporting requirements. Without this major feature, unit's would be put in some situations where they would not be able to meet the timing requirement for reporting key mission information out to their commanders. This feature allowed them to meet that timeline and further proved that our tool can replace other tools that units are using which would be a huge time save for them all.\n3. Improved customer relations - In the middle of this contract period, we were struggling a bit with roles/responsibilities and customer trust. We had some situations that were not ideal related to releases and miscommunications. We have taken steps to improve this trust and get our customer what they need to properly do their jobs on the government side. We had more collaborative meetings and I started specifically having 1 on 1's with one of the govt folks on their side which helped weed out key action items for myself and the team to take on. I believe our customer relations have improved drastically. We have gained customer trust, and as a result they are less \"in the weeds\" technically with our team. We have the autonomy to run a product team as it should and our customer is happy and getting the information they need to run their side of the table. This has lead to more time available for Risers to get work done as well as increased customer satisfaction and trust with our customer for future projects.",
  "enps_comments": "**Danny Benson:**\nEvan is a senior product manager whose approachable demeanor supports effective collaboration with both the team and stakeholders. He has been instrumental in maintaining stakeholder communication, regularly checking in and seeking feedback to ensure alignment between the team and product owners.\n\n\n\n\nEvan has demonstrated initiative in managing these responsibilities, but continued focus on strengthening core product management practices\u2014such as maintaining a fully fleshed-out backlog and a clear product roadmap\u2014will be important to ensure engineering efforts are guided effectively. A key area for development is proactive preparation before stakeholder engagements. Deepening his subject-matter expertise will directly enhance his self-assurance and reinforce stakeholder trust, which are foundational to his continued impact.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nI can really only base my responses off observations and interactions during stand up. I'm relatively new to this team and can't think of things I've worked on with Evan. I definitely see him thinking critically, repeatedly asking questions to uncover the technical understandings, and pushing for the best solution for our customer, but our professional relationship is more of acquaintances.\n\n**Cory:**\nEvan has been a steady source of light-heartedness and connection within the team.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nFrom the interactions I have with Evan, mainly during team wide meetings, I can tell that he is a very good product manager that gets the team pointing in the right direction. He is also very easy to talk to and is approachable so it is easy to get a hold of him and get questions answered. He was also extremely knowledgable when it came to the application when I finished onboarding, which was immensely helpful in getting a better grip on the project and the customer.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\nEvan is a highly effective PM and a pleasure to collaborate with. He has demonstrated notable adaptability and perseverance while managing the demands of a complex project and contract environment. Crucially, he has consistently leveraged this resilience to build deep, foundational trust with our key clients, which has been invaluable for navigating challenging trade-offs and decisions.\n\n**Sagar Akre:**\nHere is the version with no em dashes:\n# **Why I Selected \u201cAgree\u201d (Not \u201cStrongly Agree\u201d) for Rehiring Evan**\nEvan is often the glue of the team. He supports morale, helps people feel heard, and creates an environment where collaboration is easy and healthy. On those interpersonal dimensions, he operates at a \u201cstrongly agree\u201d level.\n\n\n\n\nThe reason I did not select \u201cstrongly agree\u201d is because he needs to bring more rigor and intentionality to client interactions. He often wings conversations or assembles slides quickly rather than designing the interaction to achieve a specific outcome. With this client especially, polished visual communication, clear narratives, and intentional preparation matter. I would like to see him pull in the right people earlier, plan the message, and think strategically about how he communicates both verbally and visually.\n\n\n\n\nIn addition, deeper domain and technical understanding would help avoid situations where incorrect assumptions are communicated with confidence. Building more consistency in project management fundamentals, not just product strategy, would also strengthen his impact.\nEvan has the right attitude, strong interpersonal skills, and natural team glue qualities. With more preparation, better communication design, and deeper technical and context understanding, he can easily move into the \u201cstrongly agree\u201d category.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\nEvan manages stakeholders effectively, handles release planning well, and helps protect engineers from unnecessary meetings. These strengths make day-to-day work more efficient and less stressful.\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nEvan is a top-tier product manager known for his ability to bridge the gap between engineering capabilities and customer requirements. Highly outcome-driven, he consistently prioritizes the customer and the company mission. He expertly translates customer feedback into clear technical requirements, guiding engineers to successful results while embodying the company's core values.\n\n**Becca James:**\nEvan solidly exemplifies many of the Rise8's values on a regular basis. I am often struck by how adept he is at giving and receiving feedback, and having the right conversation even when it's difficult. He shows up with his full-self and is dedicated to supporting our customer and their mission.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nEvan has done an okay job.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Dan Bitter:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n\n**Cory:**\nSomething that I enjoy from Evan is the casual and light-hearted personality while also having no fear of digging into problems to get to the root cause.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nI like how easy going you are when in meetings or in 1:1s, it makes it very easy to approach you and ask questions about anything. I also like how you are on top of scheduling all meetings that are required for the team. Occasionally the meetings get too off topic and I've noticed that it normally takes someone else to get the meeting back on track, so I would recommend trying to make sure they get back on track sooner or don't go off track in the first place (if possible).\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\n**Start prioritizing technical domain expertise:** Actively dedicate time to deepening technical understanding of the 'Warp Core' system, including hands-on activities, to better evaluate technical complexity and feasibility.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop relying on silent reading of user stories during IPMs:** Instead, focus on presenting and storytelling during the IPM. This ensures the context, user motivation, and desired outcome are clearly and efficiently communicated to the engineering team.\n\n\n\n\n**Continue focusing on production-bound outcomes:** Maintain the current rigor in collaborating directly with clients to ensure prioritized features and enhancements are consistently driven through to measurable impact in the production environment.\n\n**Sagar Akre:**\n## **Start Doing**\n- Building a stronger mental model of the platform and its underlying mechanics so he can communicate more effectively and confidently with stakeholders.\n- Embracing his role as a communication leader by being intentional in how he prepares for and conducts conversations with clients. This includes designing communication for a specific outcome, being thoughtful about both verbal and visual clarity, and ensuring that what is presented builds trust and demonstrates competence.\n- Taking more ownership of *how* information is communicated, not just *what* is communicated, and developing deeper technical fluency to support stronger client guidance.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\n**Keep:** Managing releases smoothly and shielding the team from unneeded distractions.\n**Start:** Capturing important details more consistently to avoid information getting lost or revisited unnecessarily.\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nStart: Provide Direct Feedback and Amplify Leadership\n\n\n\n\nYou should start providing more direct and candid feedback, leveraging your deep technical expertise to offer raw, unvarnished insights that drive immediate clarity and action. Concurrently, actively call out and address instances where engineers or customers are deviating from the core mission, ensuring strategic focus is maintained across the board. By continuing to leverage your exceptional leadership skills and strong charisma, you can powerfully unify stakeholders, guide customers toward mission alignment, and empower engineers to maximize their output of successful outcomes.\n\n\n\n\nStop: Gatekeeping Your Engineer Knowledge :P\n\n\n\n\nYou should prioritize the systematic transfer of your deep engineering knowledge throughout the team, rather than inadvertently limiting its circulation. While we recognize your time is extremely valuable and must be protected for high-leverage work, we encourage you to identify focused, opportunistic moments to share your wisdom, especially during periods of reduced high-priority tasks. Proactively distributing this expertise will accelerate skill development and strengthen the overall technical foundation of the entire organization.\n\n\n\n\nKeep: Continue High-Impact Mentorship and Guidance\n\n\n\n\nYou must continue serving as a subject matter expert and mentor because your extensive engineering experience is an invaluable asset to both internal teams and customers. Sustain your high-impact guidance by teaching both customers and engineers how to excel in their respective roles, leveraging your technical background to drive best practices, promote efficient communication, and ensure engineering solutions consistently align with genuine customer needs.\n\n**Becca James:**\nContinue: Living in a feedback and growth mindset, not just for yourself but for others on the team too.\nStart: I would love to see Evan turn up the volume on his pace of delivery execution being the champion behind speed to outcomes, articulation of product strategy, and demonstrating strong ownership of the roadmap internally and with customers. A place to start here would be to highly focus on setting up your next project with the thinking that comes from workshops and artifacts to lay a strong foundation for your product execution.\nContinue: Building confidence in yourself with our customer so that you can have strong relationships with stakeholders on your next project.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nI would recommend using this new work opportunity as a way to understand the platform of warp core and become more familiar with some of the intricacies. This will help you better understand the product and the scope of work needed for a change.\n\n\n\n\nStart encouraging the team to point out stories from the beginning.\n",
