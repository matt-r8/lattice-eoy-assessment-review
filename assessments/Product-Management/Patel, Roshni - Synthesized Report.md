<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

**1. Leading Discovery & Framing for SATCOM and delivering actionable outcomes in under 30 days**
I drove multiple Discovery & Framing efforts that enabled the SATCOM team to move from ambiguity to clarity quickly. By facilitating stakeholder alignment, synthesizing complex technical workflows, and ensuring each problem was well-framed, I helped the team deliver 3 outcomes in 145 days. 




**Impact:** Accelerated our speed to value, reduced rework, and strengthened Rise8’s reputation for rapid, high-quality framing—especially in a complex mission environment.




**2. Raising the quality bar for product collaboration through hiring and practice support**
I actively contributed to interviewing PM candidates and shaping what “good” looks like within the PM practice. By helping evaluate candidates and providing feedback across the practice, I supported the growth and consistency of our product discipline.




**Impact:** Helped ensure Rise8 continues hiring strong product talent and reinforced high product standards across teams, directly supporting our mission to deliver exceptional outcomes for clients.




**3. Driving alignment and creating cohesion across the PM/PD function**
I was part of the team who organized the PM/PD offsite to strengthen team collaboration, shared understanding, and alignment on how we operate. This included helping plan content and facilitating on-site behind the scene needs.




**Impact:** Improved cross-team cohesion, increased clarity around roles and workflow expectations, and supported a healthier, more effective product organization—ultimately enabling Rise8 teams to deliver faster and with less friction.

Your performance as a Senior PM is outstanding. You excel at product discovery, defining problems, and laying out clear outcomes that directly set our team up for success; your Value Stream Mapping artifact is consistently the best across the team. You manage stakeholders masterfully: always respectful, yet highly effective at pushing back and steering them toward the right direction, which is especially important with our new stakeholder. You are an exceptional team advocate, consistently considering engineering capacity, and you create a relaxed environment where no one ever feels rushed to work on tasks.
