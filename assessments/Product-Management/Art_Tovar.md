**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I **strongly believe** I would be enthusiastically rehired because my primary focus is enabling the team's ability to drive mission impact, putting them in the best position to deliver outcomes our customers love. As demonstrated by consistently operating as a Team Leader, I continuously prioritize what is best for the customer and the company.




**Leading with Transparency:** I embody **Keep it Real** by ensuring radical truth and radical transparency are practiced across the team, surfacing disagreements constructively, and taking full ownership of results without excuse or blame. 




**Cultivating A-Player Culture:** I live the **Always Be Kind** value by challenging directly and providing quality feedback in a manner that builds trust and helps teammates operate as A Players, driving the performance and growth of the team overall.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:** I will start actively positioning myself as a strategic leader in the VA space to influence how Rise8 can expand its footprint. This includes consistently seeking out and sharing undeniable proof of our outcomes (like the 48K error reduction) with senior, non-team stakeholders to advocate for new mission impact opportunities, fulfilling the Be Bold value and my passion for impacting Veterans for the good.




**Stop:** I will stop occasionally defaulting to passive acceptance or avoiding necessary direct conversations when providing peer feedback or challenging a decision. Instead, I commit to consistently practicing radical candor and providing honest, open, and direct feedback to ensure my teammates and the organization achieve their full A Player potential. This enables lower team health and hinders the ability to fulfill our promise.




**Keep Doing:** I will **keep doing** my job as a "multiplier" by cultivating meaningful relationships at the VA and ensuring I help my stakeholder stays aligned on the  biggest outcomes and act as an owner of the VA watchtower contract.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. I successfully drove and supported **2 user outcomes** and **3 supporting outcomes** this year, all focused on advancing our mission to continuously deliver valuable software users love. My top three outcome were:
   1. **Secure Messaging Access Restored:** Collaborated directly with the upstream My HealtheVet team to identify a critical API bug that caused over 48,000 errors. The resultant fix eliminated all these errors, restoring a critical healthcare communication channel for Veterans and directly contributing toward the OMTM of reducing VA errors by 50%. This incident helped shift the team mindset from reactive to proactive, demonstrating **Grit** and **Growth Mindset**.
   2. **Mitigating Security Risk via On-Premise CyberChef:** Led the deployment and accreditation of an on-premise version of CyberChef on the secure Unified Platform. The **Outcome** is that users now process sensitive mission data exclusively with the secure, on-prem tool, mitigating a significant security risk for the customer (demonstrating **Do The Right Thing**).
   3. **Restored Accurate Performance Baseline for Appointments Service:** Investigated and deployed a code change to the appointments service that correctly reclassified an expected empty data response from a critical 500 error to a success (204). **Quantitatively**, this specific error count was reduced from ~22,000 to 0 in 7 days, eliminating "false positive" alerts. This re-established an accurate performance baseline, directly improving our 'Reduce Errors' OKR and restoring a trustworthy view of service health for VA stakeholders, demonstrating the principle to **Keep it Real**.
2. **Strategic Leadership and Realignment in a Vacuum (Watchtower Team):** I immediately took the reins of the **Watchtower team's** Product Manager function, a moment that required swift, decisive action. I redefined the team's strategic direction by collaborating with the team and stakeholders to build a value stream map, an impact map, and a new roadmap. This strategic focus led to the successful delivery of **one User Outcome and one Supporting Outcome** soon after. **Customer satisfaction increased significantly**, leading the stakeholder to request sharing our success with their leadership, demonstrating my **Grit** and capacity to **Do What is Required** for mission continuity.
3. **Accelerating Value Delivery Post-Team Consolidation (Unified Platform):** Faced with the challenge of combining two teams into the **Unified Platform** team and a looming contract end, I quickly organized the team to identify and prioritize the top customer problems. This rapid, focused strategy enabled the successful delivery of **one User Outcome and two Supporting Outcomes** before the contract concluded, demonstrating consistent results and high-agency execution in a dynamic environment.

**Comment**:
> Art has been instrumental in bringing structure, alignment, and cohesion to the team.  Shortly after joining, he quickly learned the project's context and established a clear direction by organizing conversations that aligned the team and stakeholder around specific goals.  His ability to create clarity and drive follow-through has elevated the entire team's performance.




Art's coordination and communication skills are exceptional.  He ensures critical meetings happen, keeps leadership informed, and translates discussions into actionable next steps.  He balances accountability with morale - celebrating wins, scheduling "mandatory fun", and helping the team feel connected while maintaining focus on delivery.




He's also taken on the responsibility of "manning the Watch" and reducing open tickets, which has noticeably improved team responsiveness and workload management.  Art is reliable, organized, and a positive presence who makes the team feel both supported and capable.  Since his arrival, the tam has operated with stronger structure, higher visibility, and greater cohesion across all fronts.
