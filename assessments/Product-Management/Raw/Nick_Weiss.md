### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Yes, I have dedicated my efforts this year to being a foundational support for the team and learning about a domain I am new to while focusing not just on our output but on the health, alignment, and culture of how we work together. I believe my contributions in these specific areas are highly valued by my peers and would be the primary reasons they would want to continue working with me.
My belief is based on the following:
- I take active ownership of our team's operational rhythm. I organize, facilitate, and own the team cadence—from planning sessions and retrospectives to ad-hoc discussions—that is essential to keeping us aligned, untangling dependencies, and ensuring our work moves forward smoothly.
- I strive to be highly approachable and create a safe environment for open communication. I actively solicit and welcome feedback on our team practices and am transparent about my own areas for development, including my technical knowledge. A core priority for me is ensuring that *all* opinions, ideas, and thoughts are heard and valued, which I believe fosters psychological safety and leads to better collective decisions.
- I work hard to insulate the team from distractions. I serve as a filter for administrative requirements, organizational noise, and shifting priorities, allowing my technical teammates to maintain deep focus. My colleagues know I will strongly defend our team, our technical decisions, and their expert opinions to outside stakeholders.
- I treat my teammates as whole people, not just employees. I prioritize empathy and recognize that we all have personal responsibilities and lives that occasionally take precedence. By making room for this and fostering a culture of flexibility, we are able to support each other and get our work done in a sustainable, human-centric way that builds long-term trust and resilience.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### Continue
- **Owning and facilitating the team's cadence:** I will keep managing our team ceremonies (planning, retros, etc.) to ensure we stay aligned and collaborative.
- **Fostering psychological safety:** I will keep actively soliciting feedback and ensuring all voices on the team are heard and respected.
- **Prioritizing a human-centric culture:** I will keep leading with empathy and providing the flexibility our team needs to balance work and personal lives.
- **Defending the team's focus:** I will keep acting as a shield for the team, protecting them from unnecessary distractions and administrative overhead so they can focus on high-impact technical work.
- **Technical Upskilling:** I will continue to address my new-ness to the Platform domain head on by actively dedicating time to deepen my understanding of our architecture. This will help me better advocate for their technical decisions.
- **Iteration on work intake**: I will continue to iterate on our work intake process so that it is clearly documented and accessible across the portfolio, the impact and urgency is understood, and we will continue to iterate on routing this work to other suitable teams that can address the needs when possible so that Platform can stay as heads down as possible in setting up the platform to unblock the needs of other teams.




### Start
- **Move from facilitating to optimizing:**
   - Start proactively measuring the effectiveness of our team cadence. I plan to track metrics on meeting overhead vs. focus time and work with the team to experiment with changes.
- **Move from *defending* the team to *proactively* leading have the Platform team lead:**
   - We've experienced some churning around the scope of the contract, technical path we're taking, and defining the requisite work and aligning that with desired deadlines. I plan to take a more proactive role in helping elevate the Platform Team to drive more of these decisions rather than reacting to them via a closer working relationship with the Portfolio team and better ability to anticipate issues with my deepening technical and domain understanding.
### Stop Doing
- **Pulling on our own Engineers for as much explanation.** I'm actively working to be less dependent on our Engineers to answer technical "Why" questions with the goal to minimize the number of asks I have for them in this regard.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. **Spearheaded Platform Team Alignment for IL5 Readiness:** I took ownership of aligning the Platform team around a comprehensive and clear plan for achieving IL5 production readiness, namely in the great detail I've put into our Epic 6 Foundational Cluster build plan. This strategic plan will be critical for successfully onboarding the Nova team and serves as our roadmap to demonstrate tangible platform value ahead of contract renewal. This work also acted as a catalyst across the portfolio, as it identified and highlighted key dependencies that will unblock numerous other teams, enabling them to plan their own work effectively by identifying the minimum critical path we need to take to accelerate our delivery timeline.
2. **Rapid Upskilling in Platform Engineering:** I've achieved a significant and rapid upskilling in platform engineering, learning the complex requirements of IL5/IL6 environments, their components, and their service dependencies. Coming from an application development background, this new knowledge has allowed me to more accurately identify dependencies, facilitate credible technical discussions with engineers, and serve as a more effective advocate and translator for our team's work to clients and stakeholders.
3. **Maintained Team Velocity by Mitigating Critical Blockers:** Despite major setbacks in gaining access to DAF Cloudworks, I ensured the team was able to make meaningful and continuous progress toward our goals. By proactively facilitating complex conversations across our team, other portfolio teams, and the client, I helped us pivot to a high-value workaround: building a mock air-gapped environment. This initiative keeps the team fully engaged on important work and, crucially, will significantly accelerate our delivery timeline once the formal access is unblocked.

**Comment**:
> Working with Nick has been a breath of fresh air in many ways, especially compared to my past experiences with PMs. I truly appreciate his tenacity and craftiness in working through the necessary steps to help us achieve our goals.
It's clear that platform engineering is new territory for him, and I've been genuinely impressed and proud of how quickly he's worked to learn complex concepts. This project is a massive challenge, and while he has struggled to keep up at times, his commitment to gaining ground is commendable. As an engineer, I appreciate that he makes processes lean where he can. My hope is that as he continues to grow his technical knowledge, he will be able to take on more of the planning process independently, reducing the oversight needed from the engineering team.
On a personal level, he's a really good friend. I appreciate our conversations and feel safe talking to him about my frustrations and those of the team, which is an invaluable quality in a PM.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep being tenacious and effective in your planning.** Your ability to navigate the path to our goals is a huge asset.
- **Keep diving into the technical details.** Your dedication to learning a complex new domain is impressive and is the key to your long-term success in this role.
- **Keep being a trusted and safe person for the team to confide in.** This is a superpower for a PM and makes our team stronger and more honest.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start carving out time for some hands-on experience with our core technologies.** I know you're very hands-on in other aspects of your life, and I believe applying that same mindset here could be a game-changer. Getting even a basic feel for the tech will build immense empathy for the engineering team's work and deepen your understanding of the complexities we navigate. With modern AI tools making this more accessible than ever, even simple exercises could provide a valuable firsthand perspective that will undoubtedly translate into even more effective planning.




#### **Stop Doing**
- **Stop deferring *too much* to AI.** While we all appreciate how AI can accelerate our work, and I definitely think you should keep using it, it's crucial to be mindful of its limitations. We've encountered situations where its output is deceptively plausible—it *looks* right but is subtly incorrect or "hallucinated." This can create confusion and requires extra cycles from the team to decipher and correct. I'd encourage you to treat AI as a starting point, not a substitute for your own critical analysis and contextual understanding.

Start: Collaborating more and bringing lean design processes into the fold where there are opportunities. I see potential for brainstorming / ideation around inner-loop features that might be really valuable to app devs and could "wow" govt stakeholders. Would like to collaborate with him on things like this. We've been very focused on urgent engineering work, but we could carve out time to discover low-cost / high impact features that we scope down to what we could potentially deliver..

**Comment**:
> Nick has a solid PM skillset and brings a much needed product focus to the platform team. Nick is always great to work with and is collaborative. I think the overall engagement would have benefitted from him linking the platform team priorities, epics and activities to the portfolio/higher level goals earlier.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Implementing a sense of urgency in the development of high level priorities and mapping those to the greater goals and communicate how that is going early and often. Early development of a roadmap and high level epics is helpful to ensure everyone is aligned on the path forward. Pairing with portfolio engineering or other platform engineering SMEs would also be helpful.
Stop: Don't hesitate in communicating any challenges in outlining high level priorities and backlog development. If the team is moving in a direction for platform development that doesn't support the company priority of outcomes in production as soon as possible, push back on this (maybe you have already) but make this visible  and also discuss with internal stakeholders.
Keep: Applying your strong product practices and experience to the platform team and keeping the team focused on outcomes, especially those aligned with the company mission, e.g. outcomes in prod as soon as possible.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep:**
- **Bringing rigor and pragmatism to the Platform Team.** I was incredibly grateful for the way you urged the team to utilize a backlog and structured outlines rather than leaving work nebulous. This was critical for Leadership and the Portfolio team to understand our direction and status.
- **Managing stakeholders and protecting the team.** You were consistently transparent about risks and responsive to asks/deadlines. I especially appreciated how you shielded the team from external stress regarding the unachievable deadlines while still trying to move the engagement in a positive direction.
- **Standing your ground.** You did a great job adding process even when dealing with strong-headed engineers who tried to control the situation.
**Stop:**
- **Letting the "Risk Analysis" phase linger too long.** While identifying risks is part of your job, there were times when we spent too much time outlining *why* the strategy/timeline wouldn't work, rather than pivoting to *how* we could solve it. Once the risk is flagged, try to minimize the time spent "admiring the problem" and move faster toward ownership of the solution.
- **Allowing the engineering silo to persist.** While you eventually held them accountable, there were times when the engineers were not pausing to pair or transfer context to you. Don't wait to correct this dynamic; stop the line immediately if the team is leaving you behind on context.
**Start:**
- **Deepening your application of the "Outcomes" methodology.** I recommend you lean further into the Rise8 mindset of "Outcomes in 180 days." Instead of viewing constraints (like the timeline) as reasons why we *can't* succeed, start using them as forcing functions to break the problem down into smaller, achievable wins.
- **Driving the "How."** When the overall strategy feels disconnected from reality, I would love to see you take the lead earlier in saying, "Here is the bad situation, now let's talk about how we fix it." Shifting from *risk reporter* to *solution architect* slightly earlier will make your life easier and help the team navigate difficult engagements.

> Nick is a valuable A player on FORGE. He does a great job at organizing our backlog and making sure that our team is aligned on priorities every week. Although he is newer to platform he doesn't shy away from learning new things or gaining context into stories. Does a great job with roadmapping and keeping us organized.

> Keep up with aligning us with our expected priorities and shielding us from work you see as not priority for us to reach our goals. You have done a great job doing that by setting up a process for external teams to get support from us which is awesome. Don't be afraid to push us more on being involved in planning stages/etc, it is sometimes seen as busy work for us and we would rather develop but we know it is important so let us know if you require more input on certain activities we are happy to help!

**Comment**:
> Nick has demonstrated impressive resilience and a growth mindset while onboarding onto a platform engagement with an exceptionally steep technical learning curve. Mastering these technical components and the domain context is no small feat, yet he has taken the challenge in stride, growing his fluency every week. His proactive approach to partnership and his receptivity to feedback are accelerating his trajectory, proving he is up to the task of navigating this complex environment.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start** translating technical complexity into business strategy. As you master the platform's technical components, start converting that knowledge into simple narratives that explain the value of the platform to non-technical stakeholders. Acting as the bridge between the code and the customer value, moving from understanding the tech to selling the capability, is the next step in your growth.
- Start defining the multi-year strategy for the platform. Don't just learn the current state; begin to define the future state. Use your growing technical context to proactively manage constraints and start building a roadmap that balances immediate technical debt with long-term mission impact.
- **Consider** that the role is to be the "translator," not just the "student." While it is important to learn the technology, the ultimate goal is to provide objective expertise to overcome challenges. You don't need to know every line of code, but you do need to know enough to strategically challenge the status quo. Shift conversations with engineers from "How does this work?" to "Help me understand the trade-offs of this approach so I can advise on the larger strategic direction."
- **Consider** the mission impact of the platform. Platform work can sometimes feel removed from the end user. Continuously challenge yourself to connect the technical component you are learning to a specific mission outcome or change in user behavior. If you can't draw that line, the roadmap may need adjustment.
- **Keep** navigating the ambiguity of a complex technical domain. Your ability to take the steep curve in stride establishes your credibility and sets the tone for the team. This resilience is the foundation of success in complex domains.
- **Keep** actively seeking partnership to deepen understanding. You are authentically engaging stakeholders (esp. engineers) to co-create your understanding. Continue this, as it is the fastest way to increase the breadth and depth of your knowledge before technical challenges become blockers.
