**Comment**:
> Ian has been an excellent PM, successfully navigating the bureaucratic process to get Blitzar Operationally Accepted. This included managing stakeholders through a difficult organization transition and aggressively pursuing avenues of funding and policy for Blitzar's capabilities. This is direct evidence of his outcome focus. Furthermore, Ian serves as a critical technical liaison: he rapidly demonstrated his aptitude by easily mastering our SMTP Client/Relay architecture and immediately translating those diagrams and workflows to stakeholders. This ability to understand and speak intelligently about our technical approaches accelerates alignment and reduces the need for engineers to spend time translating internal complexities. Finally, Ian is a great teammate who brings a highly positive vibe; he puts effort into knowing his teammates on a personal level, which is foundational to building a strong, collaborative team environment.

**Comment**:
> I collaborate with Ian regularly during standups, IPMs, retros, team discussions, and user research. He is straightforward, outcome focused, and understands his role as PM well. He trusts the team to execute and pushes with urgency when needed without micromanaging.




Ian consistently keeps the team aligned and makes sure we understand stakeholder goals and priorities. He communicates feedback clearly and considers engineering and design implications before making decisions. He creates space for open discussion and maintains an environment where the team feels comfortable contributing.




During onboarding, even when Blitzar was in a busy stage, he took the time to share documents and provide domain context, which helped me ramp up faster. He made sure I had access to everything I needed and checked in regularly. He also pushed for approval for me to join a user research trip within three weeks of joining the team, which helped me understand the product firsthand and build trust early. His leadership helped move Blitzar into production faster than expected.




Ian demonstrated that he can lead the team from alignment to production outcomes while maintaining a culture of trust and open dialogue. He keeps communication open and makes it easy for anyone on the team to bring up ideas or concerns without hesitation.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Ian could start sharing more of his PM thought process with the team. A simple walkthrough of how he prioritizes work or manages tradeoffs would help others understand his approach and could be valuable for anyone interested in moving toward a PM path. Even lightweight documentation or informal sessions could go a long way.




At times he takes on too much himself. Distributing responsibilities earlier and showing how he arrives at decisions could help build stronger ownership across the team and prepare others to take on bigger roles.




He should continue keeping the team aligned and focused on outcomes. His clear communication, urgency, and transparency with stakeholders are valuable to team culture. The trust he built during onboarding and his effort to involve people early had a direct impact on my ability to contribute, and I would like to see him keep that approach as a leader.
