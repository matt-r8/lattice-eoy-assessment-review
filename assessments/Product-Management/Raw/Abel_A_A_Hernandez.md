**2. Maintain Resilience:** Limit time spent stalled to no more than a couple of hours when ideas or suggestions don't pan out or fail to get the expected reaction, *repeat Step 1. Go get feedback!*




**3. Uphold Culture:** Keep my passion and enthusiasm focused on helping our team dynamic, company culture, and core practices grow.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. I organized and facilitated the Core Practice Scenarios fair at our Duck Key Off-Site. to establish a dynamic learning environment for Risers. This directly supported our mission by fostering increased confidence in delivering constructive feedback and driving professional growth. [February - June]
2. Through proactive user discovery, I identified a critical user segment (Delta Commander Staffers) and their 10.5+ hour manual data aggregation and reporting burden resulted in the hypothesis for providing them with direct access to our OPSCAP Report data. This outcome now ensures near-real-time data is readily available in 2 mins or less, improving Combat Forces Command (CFC) mission resource allocation planning. [April - August]
3. I led our user segmentation strategy based on Adoption and Efficiency metrics, overcoming customer resistance to data-informed prioritization. These efforts are helping establish an iterative method for measuring progress and delivering higher-quality outcomes. [August - December]

**Comment**:
> Abel is one of the most affable, likable, and grounding PMs I have worked with. He brings a thoughtful balance of strong opinions, structure, and collaboration that has significantly improved how our team operates. Before he joined, many of our PM practices were loose or inconsistent, and he immediately introduced discipline, clarity, and process maturity that elevated our delivery.
He has also grown noticeably in empathy toward client needs and has taken a proactive role in aligning the team around those needs. He pushes for clarity, better communication, and meaningful progress, and his influence has helped us close important gaps.




In addition, Abel has made strong progress toward his goals around product vision, strategy, outcomes, and impact. He is becoming increasingly effective at articulating what we are building and why, identifying the right metrics, and partnering with engineering to ensure we gather the data we need. His fluency with analytics and his ability to operationalize those insights have been especially impressive.




Abel is an incredibly positive force on the team, and his presence, leadership, and work ethic make him someone I would enthusiastically rehire.

> ## **Start Doing**
- Start trusting his instincts and leaning into action instead of waiting for permission. When he sees a strategic gap or an outcome misalignment, he should move quickly to address it.
- Start stepping into vision and strategy work with more confidence by driving conversations, shaping direction, and defining outcomes without second-guessing past constraints.
## **Stop Doing**
- Stop undervaluing the impact of his contributions or hesitating due to previous leadership dynamics on the contract.
- Stop defaulting to consensus-building when decisive action would serve the team better.
## **Keep Doing**
- Keep bringing discipline, structure, and high standards for how a software delivery team should operate.
- Keep excelling in metrics and analytics work, including identifying what needs to be measured, communicating it clearly, and partnering with engineering to make it real.
- Keep bringing empathy, collaboration, and clarity to both client and internal conversations.

> Abel is an exceptional Product Manager who significantly boosts his team's effectiveness by expertly balancing strategic alignment and operational excellence. He constantly drives the team toward measurable production outcomes, not just task completion, by aligning their efforts with core business objectives and actively assisting by proactively removing roadblocks and facilitating crucial cross-functional communication. His consistent adherence to team norms models professional discipline, fosters a culture of mutual accountability, and builds high trust within the group. Furthermore, his superior organizational skills are invaluable, translating directly into highly efficient processes, a well-groomed and prioritized product backlog, and clear, readily accessible documentation that minimizes ambiguity and maximizes the time the team spends building.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Deepening Technical Understanding
I encourage you to deepen your understanding of the technical aspects inherent in our development work. While your current focus on the customer mission and business outcomes is highly commendable, a stronger technical foundation will allow you to frame the bigger picture of our deliveries, lead more informed discussions on feasibility and risk, and more effectively gauge the scope and complexity of initiatives, thereby enhancing your strategic decision-making and improving overall alignment with the engineering team.




Stop: Over-Indexing on Operational Details
To optimize your strategic bandwidth, I recommend you step back from worrying about minor operational details that do not directly impact the customer mission or prevent us from achieving key outcomes. While it is good to be informed, seeking exhaustive knowledge on every granular task can be a drain on your time; instead, rely on your experienced team members to provide synthesized summaries of information relevant to critical decisions and strategic progress.




Keep: Strategic Focus and Process Adherence
Maintain your sharp focus on the customer mission and consistently shipping high-value outcomes, which is a core strength that significantly accelerates team productivity. Your rigorous adherence to our established processes and team norms is an essential component of this success, as your discipline creates clarity, reduces friction, and allows the entire team to be more productive and reliably deliver impactful results.

**Comment**:
> I only started working with Abel recently, so I was surprised to hear he was working to rise above B-player status. He explained his previous assumption of PM duties being temporary, so I can understand his perspective and leadership's concern. That said, he's been a great example of an involved PM while I've been on the contract. He asks as many questions as necessary until his understanding is clear. He's sure to follow up until things are complete. His proposed metrics are a creative way to display quantitative value to the customer.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep doing
- Asking great, thorough questions to understand technical areas of implementation and risks
- Keeping the atmosphere light when appropriate vs on-task when appropriate
Stop doing
- It doesn't happen often, but Abel sometimes guesses at the answer after asking someone a question. It makes more sense to me to ask the question, receive the answer, and ask follow up questions as needed. This review question reminded of this feedback and I'll be sure to talk with Abel 1:1 when we're back.
Start doing
- The other day, it seems that Abel confused two parts of Warp Core, so maybe create and review a flow chart or tree graph of related Warp Core services. Seeing things in their order of operations may make it easier to know which app handles each part of the development process.

**Comment**:
> Abel is a product manager who has contributed meaningfully to the team.  His positive and collaborative presence was instrumental in fostering a high-morale team environment. He has demonstrated openness to feedback and a willingness to implement changes when challenges arise. He has taken initiative on key efforts, including setting up the Jira board and leading the ODIE Dashboard development, which have supported the team’s progress.




Abel’s positive demeanor makes him easy to collaborate with, and he has shown the ability to acknowledge areas for growth and act on them. Continued development in core product management fundamentals, technical understanding of the product, and leadership in prioritization and stakeholder communications will be important for his long-term effectiveness in this role.

**Comment**:
> Abel has demonstrated significant growth in the past few months in how he approaches problems with a positive mindset and avoids excuses. He has been receptive to feedback and dedicated effort to improving his Warp Core competence and evolved his story writing and backlog management based on feedback. 




However, his strongest skillsets are not those that the customer needs in a PM. Unfortunately, he has gaps in his ability to translate theory into practice and requires support in strategic thinking. With his dedication to improve based on feedback, I have confidence that he will dedicate himself to growing that skillset, however that skillset isn't evolved to the point where it needs to be for the pace of work required with CFE.

Stop: Don't stay in the details and occasionally come up to the strategy level to check that your direction and tasks are still the most important thing to work on
Continue: Being open to feedback and growth opportunities
