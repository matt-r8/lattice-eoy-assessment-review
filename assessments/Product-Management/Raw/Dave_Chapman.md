- As a leader, I hold primary accountability for structuring and empowering the team, ensuring the execution craft guides us to success. Crucially, I establish a balance of accountability that instills a sense of accomplishment while acting as a trusted source of representation to protect the team from external forces. This fosters the kind of healthy team environment that enables A Player performance.
- For strategy and vision, I maintain complete breadth and depth, serving as a source of inspiration and thought leadership in our product domain. I leverage fluency with data and metrics to support all rationale and decision-making, which ensures our product vision and roadmap are clearly aligned with the organization's goals.
- In my day-to-day work, I keep it real by taking full ownership of results, and my commitment to continual learning and personal growth ensures I model the growth-minded trait expected of a Riser. I deliver on commitments and exhibit the high integrity that defines an A Player.

**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**








### **Keep Doing**




I will continue to Keep Doing the hard work of seeking validated learning and holding product decisions lightly and remaining open to pivot on the features, flows, and capabilities of Tracer. This demonstrates Growth Mindset and Do What Works by ensuring we remain pragmatic and laser-focused on the core value proposition of modular, granular inheritance and not a design or solution. I will also continue to Keep it Real by taking full ownership of the product's results and impact.




### **Stop Doing**




I will Stop keeping my perspective and questions to myself out of fear of looking ignorant. This hesitation prevents the open and direct communication necessary for a high-agency environment. I commit to Be Bold by speaking up and asking clarifying or challenging questions, which is critical for driving team health and achieving A Player performance in the next cycle.




### **Start Doing**




I will Start proactively identifying and championing contract opportunities for Tracer to be tested or utilized in a trial capacity. This action directly supports my Product Manager responsibility for Vision & Strategy and creates pathways toward achieving Outcomes in Production. I will use my ground-level experience to create alignment for these opportunities across the organization.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### 1. Strategic Alignment and Deepening Domain Expertise via Tracer




I embraced the leadership decision to position the **Tracer product** on a free trial license within a key contract as an opportunity to deeply validate the value proposition. My work focused on embedding with the cyber team and compliance stakeholders to understand the reality of how practitioners implement compliance at the ground level. This led me to **adapt to real-world observations** of how business process in the compliance domain actually functions. I responded by implementing features within the Tracer workflow to enable the automation of existing artifacts to be uploaded, modifying our workflows to meet the real-world scenarios we were observing. This demonstrates **Growth Mindset** and **Keep it Real** by seeking validated learning, and ensuring the Tracer vision is built on a pragmatic understanding of user needs.




### 2. Continuous Delivery & Execution: FORGE Portfolio Alignment




On the **FORGE program**, I successfully negotiated scope and resource allocation at the portfolio level, creating alignment while rapidly testing hypotheses about outcomes and outputs. This led to a more effective portfolio structure and work alignment across multiple teams, enabling us to move toward **continuously delivering** valuable software by optimizing for flow and maximizing mission impact. This demonstrates **Do What Works** and **Do What is Required**.




### 3. Fostering a Dream Team: A Player Commitment




I proactively provided honest, direct, and quality feedback to delivery team members and portfolio leadership regarding non-A Player behaviors. This demonstrated the **courage to put our values in motion** and resulted in the difficult but necessary decision to part with senior members of the team. By ensuring we are building a team of 100% A Players, this action directly upholds our purpose and mission to build a **dream team** and aligns with the principle that not being honest and direct allows B and C Players to thrive, hindering our promise. This is the essence of **Always Be Kind** by challenging directly and providing quality feedback.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Dave for his role on my team. Dave aligns strongly with the definition of an A Player as he is highly productive, delivers on commitments, and drives critical outcomes.




He consistently demonstrates a deep understanding of the problem space and the overall vision for Tracer, often thinking about the big picture to ensure long-term success. His ability to ask hard questions and consider concerns others missed is a critical A Player trait, as A Players bring solutions, not problems.




Dave's performance following his leave, where he quickly adapted to a significant pivot and picked up right where he left off, speaks to his high accountabilityand resilience. He immediately added value, demonstrating the kind of productivity and focused alignment that an organization needs.

> - Continue to leverage and share your deep domain knowledge. This knowledge is a critical asset that helps the entire team ask the right questions and maintain alignment on complex integration challenges. Continue to use this expertise to drive mission/business impact.
- Maintain the high level of adaptability demonstrated during the strategic pivot. Your ability to re-engage quickly and move forward in the new direction, even when previous work required adjustment, shows strong Grit and a Growth Mindset.
- Prioritize identifying key risk areas based on long-term domain expertise. Leverage the deep knowledge of the domain to proactively identify and communicate long-term risks or opportunities in the new strategic direction, acting as the Devil's Advocate but only by bringing solutions.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Dave. He brings deep technical curiosity, strong alignment with our mission and importance of outcomes, and a genuine passion for building a product that delivers real value to users for Rise8. He shows up prepared for portfolio conversations, represents the team well in leadership settings, and is a kind, collaborative partner in day-to-day work. I also appreciate how much he cares about doing things the right way, whether that’s digging into STIGs, ODPs, and OSCAL, or advocating for risks that need to be surfaced. Working with him is grounding, thoughtful, and human, and he contributes meaningfully to the culture of our team.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
I’d love to see you keep leaning into bias for action earlier, especially when things feel ambiguous. I’ve noticed improvement from past feedback and a perfect example was your recent Slack post in the forge-delivery-general channel about the ASD STIG work. You reached out, got fast responses, and we avoided wasting time going down a wrong path. That kind of proactiveness makes a huge difference.




**Stop:**
Let’s stop getting pulled into future hypotheticals that aren’t actionable yet. I know a lot of your concern comes from wanting Tracer to fully deliver on our core value prop of inheritance/traceability. But as long as we’re aligned with stakeholders, we can only move as fast as the resources and constraints of the project we’re on allow. Trusting that we're capable to handle those bigger pieces when the timing and support are right will help us stay focused on what we can move forward today.




**Keep:**
Keep bringing your deep technical curiosity, thoughtful preparation, and genuine care for building a meaningful product. I really value how kind and collaborative you are, how much thought you put into understanding the domain, and how well you represent the team in stakeholder/external team conversations. You make it easy to work together, and that’s something I appreciate a lot!

**Comment**:
> Dave is an outstanding Product Manager who excels in navigating an incredibly complex domain. He successfully steers the team through the intricacies of RMF, constantly deepening his subject matter expertise to refine Tracer's long-term vision.




A major turning point this year was his leadership in shifting us toward a modular control structure. By enhancing our hybrid model to better align with OSCAL—specifically focusing on statements as the pivotal data point—he fundamentally improved both our internal mental model and the resulting user experience. He also brought critical clarity to our user segmentation, defining how distinct personas (Implementors vs. Assessors) and frameworks (DoD vs. FedRAMP) require unique workflows. Culturally, Dave is inclusive and collaborative, consistently looking to the engineering team to help drive prioritization and shape the roadmap.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Dave should start defining the goal and desired output for every discussion before we dive in. This applies to scheduled meetings, but especially to the 'off-the-cuff' ones. When a casual chat turns into a long debate, I want Dave to pause us and ask, 'What exactly do we need to solve right now?' Setting that direction early prevents us from spinning our wheels and helps the team focus.




Keep: Dave should keep getting into the weeds of the domain. I really appreciate that he actually takes the time to understand the messy details—like how OSCAL and statements work—instead of just staying high-level. It makes it way easier for us engineers to build the right thing when our PM actually understands the data structure.

- Start/Keep leaning into rapidly testing hypotheses; sometimes I worry you're a little too cautious when sometimes the team simply needs to take a leap and test something out to learn. Don't be afraid to guide us down a path with uncertainties, even when we know it might mean backtracking a bit when we discover that we made a bad bet.

> Before I give any comments I just want to emphasize that my context on your performance is quite limited, so you should give the most weight to feedback from your peers. I mainly see the output/outcome with no observation of activities. With that, I want to focus on two big areas for improvement, and both are related. 




1) Be bold Dave Chapman! You aren't being bold enough. We need to really go after this space. The compound startup that becomes the Salesforce/Rippling of the compliance platform space. We still haven't even bitten off eMASS, and that's just the table stakes for being a viable "platform" in this domain. I gave you and the team that as part of the vision for mission impact, but... 
2) I don't feel like we are working backwards from mission impact, or even from eMASS takeover. It feels like we are thinking small... which makes the value prop small... which makes interest in adoption small... which keeps the budget/team small. Think big! Work backwards from total domination of this space. And then get the heck after it!

> I would enthusiastically rehire Dave because he is a very skilled product manager: he excels at rigorous investigation and effectively navigating the tension between internal team needs and external stakeholder demands. Dave is dedicated to mastering the domain, I've been impressed at his dedication to research and understanding new domain challenges as they arise. He leverages AI to deepen his understanding of compliance requirements and translates that research into clear, well scoped tickets. He is transparent with the team and stakeholders, and he does not back down from defending Tracer when external teams attempt to deprioritize our goals or when misunderstandings arise. Furthermore, he fosters a collaborative environment by trusting engineering expertise and seeking feedback on his own learnings. He is tenacious in his drive to get answers but remains flexible enough to work through reasoning with others to find the best path forward. Dave is the perfect kind of manager to have for a domain as a difficult as the one that Tracer is tackling and his skills are suited for ensuring this team excels; Dave is a key asset to Tracer.

**Comment**:
> Start: Dave is excellent at presenting his learnings, but I would recommend he start being slightly more explicit about the specific agenda for meetings regarding domain findings. This is a very minor adjustment, but setting that context ahead of time would help the team better prepare for the depth of information he shares.




Stop: There is nothing that comes to mind that Dave should stop doing; his performance and interaction with the team have been excellent.




Continue: Dave should continue his rigorous investigation and defense of Tracer. He navigates tension with external teams very well and he manages the Tracer team very well, both interpersonally and also in tasks like ticket scoping and product direction/research.

I recommend working on communication pacing. You're super passionate, sometimes that can feel like a monologue. It can be challenging for collaborators to stay locked-in during a long explanation, especially during an already draining meeting. I'd suggest starting to find spots to pause and invite dialogue. Sometimes it can feel like the output of the monologue was a vocalization to learn by teaching others, more than checking if others internalized the content.
