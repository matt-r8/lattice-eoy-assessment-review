**Comment**:
> I work well collaboratively with my teammates and bring a lot of product experience to the team. In terms of the FORGE portfolio team specifically I brought an outcome and user focused approach to the project at a time when it was lacking. In terms of coaching the FORGE cyber team and PMs I was able to steer them in a positive direction by spending dedicated time with them, looking at their situation and pairing on an approach that helped them move forward in a more structured way with a focus on outcomes and tools they could use to realize these.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - Putting in place stronger accountability mechanisms when working on a portfolio, with multiple teams and also with teammates. Delegate specific areas of impact and goals to teams and individuals and then institute regular accountability check ins to course-correct if needed. Collaborate more closely with client liaison/CS when need to integrate them into strategy.
Stop - Don't always wait for full alignment before moving forward with strategy. 
Keep - Learning and developing more expertise in the areas of cyber security and the Rise8 MissionOS especially   when they are on the critical path to a client engagement.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> (6 months




- Setting up the FORGE portfolio teams with a strategy, roadmap and goals broken down with a short, medium and long term vision.
Maintained and advocated for the focus on driving towards an outcome in production despite this not being the primary goal of the client and pushback from different sources internally. Impact on Rise8 - This sets up Rise8 to be able to continue to pursue outcomes in prod for FORGE despite the setbacks in account setups that are still needed to get to production




- Coaching the FORGE cyber team:
From - A team with no effective planning, goals or backlog to milestones aligned with FORGE priorities.
To - Agile ceremonies running weekly - standup, IPM, retro. Epics and milestones now aligned with the portfolio priorities. Prioritized phases of cyber work aligned to the production outcomes goals and beyond. Cyber team now has a leader enabled in PM principles to carry this work forward.
Impact on Rise8 - This has accelerated the ability for Rise8 and the FORGE program to deliver outcomes in production as soon as possible by getting the necessary cyber work planned and executed in as short a time as possible.

> I worked with David for five months as a peer. Despite the engagement being a difficult situation that wasn't always conducive to success, I found David to be an extremely talented and pragmatic Staff PM. They are a massive asset that Rise8 should leverage on complex engagements

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **KEEP (Strengths & Behaviors to Reinforce)**




- **Pragmatic validation over speed:** You have a superpower for taking a pragmatic approach to learning. I value how you validate inputs before jumping into strategy or action. In a chaotic environment, you didn't just "do things"; you ensured we were doing the *right* things.
- **Level-headed leadership:** You were always the calmest person in the room when receiving news or new information. You consistently urged the greater team to pause and think through implications rather than reacting emotionally.
- **Collaborative "pairing" mindset:** Regardless of the stress level, you remained positive and willing to pair. This attitude kept the team moving forward together rather than fracturing under pressure.




#### **STOP (Inefficiencies & Habits to Drop)**




- **Seeking total consensus via individual alignment:** Stop trying to gain alignment with every team individually. While well-intentioned, this slowed us down. Given your role as a Staff PM, you can lean more into top-down direction when necessary to keep momentum.
- **Hesitating on accountability:** Stop waiting to see if teams will self-correct. In hindsight, we should have held the teams more accountable earlier in the engagement. Don't be afraid to set hard standards immediately, even if the environment is difficult.
- **Treating all portfolio teams equally:** Stop applying a "one size fits all" communication style. Some teams needed more directive guidance than others; recognizing those distinct maturity levels earlier would have saved time.




#### **START (Growth & Future Focus)**




- **Fully integrating the Rise8 Mission OS:** Start aligning your engagements strictly to the Mission OS (operating model) from Day 1. You have the skills to operate a mature portfolio; using the Mission OS as your default framework will help you structure that chaos faster.
- **Executing on your instincts immediately:** Start trusting your gut earlier. You have excellent product instincts—they are usually correct and true. You don't need to wait for perfect validation to execute on them; be bold in your decision-making.
- **Catering direction to team maturity:** Start assessing the maturity level of the teams in your portfolio immediately and cater your communication accordingly. High-performing teams need context; struggling teams need constraints.
