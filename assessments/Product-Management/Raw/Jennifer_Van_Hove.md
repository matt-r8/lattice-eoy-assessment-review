**Comment**:
> Over the second half of the year, I've learned a tremendous amount from working with Forge practitioners and the Bifrost team.  Having all of this project and customer context in additional to more Rise8 context has been really enlightening, and think I've leveraged that information to become much more direct and proactive working first with Bifrost and then my other USSF teams.  There is still a lot to learn about my new USSF projects and teams, but I think what I have is already enough to help address cross-cutting concerns across the portfolio and layer on some of the higher order portfolio context.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Start systems that help me keep track of project context, conversations, and IC info (learn to scale);  Connect and keep up with individuals and teams on an ongoing basis to better facilitate delivery management




Stop: Jumping between priorities as much (focus and finish); spending as much time on reactive/unplanned issues (within reason)




Continue: Gaining context in the USSF space, especially higher level context as available; Building trust with my teams; Identifying priority COAs and pushing them forward, especially in cases where they will unblock/derisk projects

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1.  I supported Bifrost as an interim PM while also managing DPL responsibilities.  During that time, we delivered a pipeline MVP, demoed it for the customer and pushed forward with ATO conversations.  Although we did not lock in the ATO, we did continually push for clarity, present new options, and drive stakeholder alignment.  I helped the team push towards less common options instead of accepting the status quo.  Bifrost is a key part of Rise8's overall strategy to help the USSF deliver capabilities - in this case, third-party apps - to warfighters.  We proved we can get apps on Apollo; now all they have to do is let us do it.  
2. I supported the PM practice as a whole by pairing with individual PMs, interviewing a steady stream of potential new PMs, and working on educational resources like the storytelling curriculum. I worked with Rise8 teams like Gateway and Forge to create and refine their value stream maps, which was a helpful way for many teams to identify missing steps in their roadmaps and help prioritize enhancements along the way.  
3. I transitioned into a DL role, which involves internalizing context for five additional projects, the portfolio as a whole, and 33 people so that I can effectively collaborate with these teams as they deliver outcomes.  Although still early in the transition, I am already identifying and planning next steps for areas of impact, such as the EM&C deployment cycle and Section 31's relationship to Project 7.

**Comment**:
> - Jenn does a phenomenal job dissecting and understanding what is unique about Rise8's culture, what it takes to be an effective PM, and creating an environment where Risers can talk about the challenges. I want to challenge Jenn to take this even further and lean into the DL position as an opportunity to further that trust with Risers by being mindful of their desire for self-validation, and encouraging them to run towards the things they are avoiding.
- Has always stepped up when we needed her support on accounts.
- Quickly synthesizes root causes and identifies contributing factors that need to be systematically addressed.
- I absolutely trust Jennifer to get the job done
- Communicates clear, and concise, feedback for any Riser, at any level, with precision
- When Jennifer volunteered to support the STRATFI Bi-frost engagement, she didn't just demonstrate leadership impact by fulfilling the PM role and responsibilities, she successfully coached and mentored the team of engineers to be self-sufficient so that transitioning to a new PM wouldn't be jarring for the team or customer.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> **Start**

- Embracing AI more and more into your daily workflows
**Stop**
- None at this time
**Keep**
- Being a context synthesis ninja
- Building trusting relationships with Risers
- Voicing challenges and solutions for challenges

**Comment**:
> Jen has been an amazing addition to Rise8 this year. I'm really looking forward to having her as Delivery Lead for several Space Force accounts and have been equally impressed with her stepping in as interim Product Manager on the STRATFI account.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start/Stop: I'm not quite sure what I would recommend Jen start and stop doing because we're operating in a fairly new construct. I hope Jen continues to bring discipline and focus on improving delivery and helping our team proactively work to remove blockers. She's already been a great partner in helping me do just that. I hope she can also point out opportunities to be more efficient in how we work or communicate as a team.

**Comment**:
> Jennifer recently transitioned off the program to accept a well-deserved promotion to Delivery Lead. During her time with our team, she consistently demonstrated exceptional focus and organization.
Her ability to take a broad, complex range of stories and organize them into a clear execution plan was instrumental to our success. Specifically, her leadership allowed us to deliver a critical capability demonstration within the first 90 days of the program—a massive achievement that speaks to her drive and clarity.

I think for next year, we should have you engage directly with customers/stakeholders more often. Your expertise, soft skills, and experience would be huge assets for the projects, and I think our customers/stakeholders would really enjoy working with you.

**Comment**:
> There is a reason I ranked Jennifer so high. Jennifer takes a problem, digests it, repeats it in a manner that is easily understandable, and works like hell to fix it. Jennifer is a great Product Manager and when I found out she was the deputy product manager, that made total sense to me. Sad we lost her as a teammate but happy to see her position grow.
