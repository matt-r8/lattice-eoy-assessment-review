**Comment**:
> Overall we have had a great year on the CFC contract. We have delivered the product that has been agreed upon as our success criteria with our stakeholders. We are at the stage where our customers are working to proliferate our applications usage/data throughout the intended space force units and C2 centers. Our app is currently used by ~26 units and is handling 1000s of reports a day which is relevant because it puts our customer in a great position to sell this application as the de facto source of truth to other C2 leadership. Our team has grown and we have started expanding the opportunities to explore on this contract. On this OPSCAP reporting effort, we have submitted 5 outcomes. We have a few more slated for the end of the year. Ideally we will have more than 7 at least by the end of the year to have 1 outcome a month and I believe we are going to hit that.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - Im starting a new effort in CFC and I want to do a better job at starting this one on the right foot. With OSIT, there was a lot of ambiguity at the start. We were still understanding how to work with our customers and were in a position where we were not evangelizing Rise8 values. We are in a MUCH better spot with our customers now and they are more bought in to our philosophy. I plan to go directly off the delivery checklist and make sure this project gets started off great. For me, this means being stricter with our artifacts, involving the customer more in meetings, and questioning them more about the "why's".
Stop - A little related to start, but I feel as if I've picked up some bad habits due to the strain of the beginning of this contract with OSIT, particularly, being skittish around communications with customers. Im already opening up a bit more but I need to make sure I don't let these feelings of "I don't want to say the wrong thing here" stop cropping up in my head. More often then not, these questions I could ask would be valuable for myself and possibly others.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Met deadline for OPSCAP reporting software - In May of this year, we NEEDED to have a OPSCAP tool in Palantir software ready for the squadrons that did not already have one. This is because of an order from a general that went out stating that it was mandatory to start reporting OPSCAP digitally. We met this deadline and had over 400 users using the application within the month. These squadrons were able to fulfill their duty of submitting digital OPSCAP reports which has allowed commanders to now organize this information more efficiently leading to more efficient and accurate decisions for battle readiness and resource allocation within Space Force.
2. Required multi-select feature - We made a feature on OSIT (our tool) that was very important for meeting strict OPSCAP reporting requirements. Without this major feature, unit's would be put in some situations where they would not be able to meet the timing requirement for reporting key mission information out to their commanders. This feature allowed them to meet that timeline and further proved that our tool can replace other tools that units are using which would be a huge time save for them all.
3. Improved customer relations - In the middle of this contract period, we were struggling a bit with roles/responsibilities and customer trust. We had some situations that were not ideal related to releases and miscommunications. We have taken steps to improve this trust and get our customer what they need to properly do their jobs on the government side. We had more collaborative meetings and I started specifically having 1 on 1's with one of the govt folks on their side which helped weed out key action items for myself and the team to take on. I believe our customer relations have improved drastically. We have gained customer trust, and as a result they are less "in the weeds" technically with our team. We have the autonomy to run a product team as it should and our customer is happy and getting the information they need to run their side of the table. This has lead to more time available for Risers to get work done as well as increased customer satisfaction and trust with our customer for future projects.

**Comment**:
> Evan is a senior product manager whose approachable demeanor supports effective collaboration with both the team and stakeholders. He has been instrumental in maintaining stakeholder communication, regularly checking in and seeking feedback to ensure alignment between the team and product owners.




Evan has demonstrated initiative in managing these responsibilities, but continued focus on strengthening core product management practices—such as maintaining a fully fleshed-out backlog and a clear product roadmap—will be important to ensure engineering efforts are guided effectively. A key area for development is proactive preparation before stakeholder engagements. Deepening his subject-matter expertise will directly enhance his self-assurance and reinforce stakeholder trust, which are foundational to his continued impact.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Ensuring full technical and contextual understanding before stakeholder discussions.** This will increase confidence and improve credibility with stakeholders and the team.
- **Proactively maintaining key product management artifacts.** Keeping a clear roadmap and fully prioritized backlog will help guide engineering efforts and clarify team priorities.
- **Taking stronger ownership of product direction.** Actively leading prioritization decisions will ensure the product evolves in alignment with goals rather than leaving direction-setting to engineers.
### 
**STOP / REDUCE**
- **Allowing gaps in basic product management practices.** When fundamentals are overlooked, confusion arises in team priorities and execution; reducing these gaps will improve clarity and efficiency.
### 
**KEEP DOING**
- **Maintaining strong stakeholder communication.** Regular check-ins and open feedback-seeking help align expectations and support product delivery.
- **Being approachable and collaborative.** His demeanor facilitates effective teamwork and communication.
- **Supporting the team’s alignment and engagement with stakeholders.** His efforts ensure that the team and product owners stay connected and coordinated.

He is also very easy to talk to and is approachable so it is easy to get a hold of him and get questions answered. He was also extremely knowledgable when it came to the application when I finished onboarding, which was immensely helpful in getting a better grip on the project and the customer.

> I like how easy going you are when in meetings or in 1:1s, it makes it very easy to approach you and ask questions about anything. I also like how you are on top of scheduling all meetings that are required for the team. Occasionally the meetings get too off topic and I've noticed that it normally takes someone else to get the meeting back on track, so I would recommend trying to make sure they get back on track sooner or don't go off track in the first place (if possible).

**Comment**:
> Here is the version with no em dashes:
# **Why I Selected “Agree” (Not “Strongly Agree”) for Rehiring Evan**
Evan is often the glue of the team. He supports morale, helps people feel heard, and creates an environment where collaboration is easy and healthy. On those interpersonal dimensions, he operates at a “strongly agree” level.




The reason I did not select “strongly agree” is because he needs to bring more rigor and intentionality to client interactions. He often wings conversations or assembles slides quickly rather than designing the interaction to achieve a specific outcome. With this client especially, polished visual communication, clear narratives, and intentional preparation matter. I would like to see him pull in the right people earlier, plan the message, and think strategically about how he communicates both verbally and visually.




In addition, deeper domain and technical understanding would help avoid situations where incorrect assumptions are communicated with confidence. Building more consistency in project management fundamentals, not just product strategy, would also strengthen his impact.
Evan has the right attitude, strong interpersonal skills, and natural team glue qualities. With more preparation, better communication design, and deeper technical and context understanding, he can easily move into the “strongly agree” category.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## **Start Doing**
- Building a stronger mental model of the platform and its underlying mechanics so he can communicate more effectively and confidently with stakeholders.
- Embracing his role as a communication leader by being intentional in how he prepares for and conducts conversations with clients. This includes designing communication for a specific outcome, being thoughtful about both verbal and visual clarity, and ensuring that what is presented builds trust and demonstrates competence.
- Taking more ownership of *how* information is communicated, not just *what* is communicated, and developing deeper technical fluency to support stronger client guidance.
## **Stop Doing**
- Relying exclusively on engineering to determine scope, complexity, or effort. Delegating all technical judgment has created gaps in the past.
- Assuming engineering-derived estimates are always correct rather than building his own understanding to challenge, validate, or clarify. Strengthening this judgment will help him communicate feasibility and expectations to clients more accurately.
## **Keep Doing**
- Continuing to be the glue of the team. His affable, empathetic, and morale-boosting presence plays a critical role in keeping the team motivated, connected, and functioning well together.
- Maintaining his ability to make teammates feel heard and supported, which is one of his greatest strengths and contributes significantly to team health.

**Comment**:
> Start: Provide Direct Feedback and Amplify Leadership




You should start providing more direct and candid feedback, leveraging your deep technical expertise to offer raw, unvarnished insights that drive immediate clarity and action. Concurrently, actively call out and address instances where engineers or customers are deviating from the core mission, ensuring strategic focus is maintained across the board. By continuing to leverage your exceptional leadership skills and strong charisma, you can powerfully unify stakeholders, guide customers toward mission alignment, and empower engineers to maximize their output of successful outcomes.




Stop: Gatekeeping Your Engineer Knowledge :P




You should prioritize the systematic transfer of your deep engineering knowledge throughout the team, rather than inadvertently limiting its circulation. While we recognize your time is extremely valuable and must be protected for high-leverage work, we encourage you to identify focused, opportunistic moments to share your wisdom, especially during periods of reduced high-priority tasks. Proactively distributing this expertise will accelerate skill development and strengthen the overall technical foundation of the entire organization.




Keep: Continue High-Impact Mentorship and Guidance




You must continue serving as a subject matter expert and mentor because your extensive engineering experience is an invaluable asset to both internal teams and customers. Sustain your high-impact guidance by teaching both customers and engineers how to excel in their respective roles, leveraging your technical background to drive best practices, promote efficient communication, and ensure engineering solutions consistently align with genuine customer needs.
