**Comment**:
> I feel that I’ve grown significantly as a Product Manager, especially in how I handle urgent stakeholder asks, clarify ambiguous requirements, and drive Discovery & Framing efforts from start to finish. I’ve consistently worked to keep the team aligned, ensure priorities are understood, and help translate technical complexity into actionable work.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
- Proactively setting clearer expectations when requesting feedback or alignment, including defining what “done” looks like and when decisions are needed.
- Asking more direct questions to uncover assumptions earlier, especially during ambiguous or fast-moving conversations.
**Stop:**
- Letting ambiguity linger in requirements or stakeholder conversations when a quick follow-up or clarification could resolve it sooner.
**Keep:**
- Maintaining strong collaboration with engineers, designers and the client to ensure technical needs and mission workflows are fully understood.
- Staying adaptable and responsive during urgent or last-minute asks while still grounding decisions in product principles.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **1. Leading Discovery & Framing for SATCOM and delivering actionable outcomes in under 30 days**
I drove multiple Discovery & Framing efforts that enabled the SATCOM team to move from ambiguity to clarity quickly. By facilitating stakeholder alignment, synthesizing complex technical workflows, and ensuring each problem was well-framed, I helped the team deliver 3 outcomes in 145 days. 




**Impact:** Accelerated our speed to value, reduced rework, and strengthened Rise8’s reputation for rapid, high-quality framing—especially in a complex mission environment.




**2. Raising the quality bar for product collaboration through hiring and practice support**
I actively contributed to interviewing PM candidates and shaping what “good” looks like within the PM practice. By helping evaluate candidates and providing feedback across the practice, I supported the growth and consistency of our product discipline.




**Impact:** Helped ensure Rise8 continues hiring strong product talent and reinforced high product standards across teams, directly supporting our mission to deliver exceptional outcomes for clients.




**3. Driving alignment and creating cohesion across the PM/PD function**
I was part of the team who organized the PM/PD offsite to strengthen team collaboration, shared understanding, and alignment on how we operate. This included helping plan content and facilitating on-site behind the scene needs.




**Impact:** Improved cross-team cohesion, increased clarity around roles and workflow expectations, and supported a healthier, more effective product organization—ultimately enabling Rise8 teams to deliver faster and with less friction.

**Comment**:
> Your performance as a Senior PM is outstanding. You excel at product discovery, defining problems, and laying out clear outcomes that directly set our team up for success; your Value Stream Mapping artifact is consistently the best across the team. You manage stakeholders masterfully: always respectful, yet highly effective at pushing back and steering them toward the right direction, which is especially important with our new stakeholder. You are an exceptional team advocate, consistently considering engineering capacity, and you create a relaxed environment where no one ever feels rushed to work on tasks.

**Keep**
Doing an awesome job as PM for our team, and honestly even for the EM&C project as a whole. It seems like you have been setting the standard and practices across the teams.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Roshni. She is an exceptional PM who has built deep trust with mission stakeholders and consistently brings clarity back to the engineering team. She communicates openly, anticipates risks, handles shifting requirements without losing momentum, and creates a supportive, transparent team environment. Her calm, steady presence and strong facilitation skills make her invaluable to the mission and the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- Pushing for clearer acceptance criteria earlier in the process, especially when planner expectations shift.
- Continuing to advocate for more upstream clarity from stakeholders to help stabilize story refinement.
### **Stop**
- Absorbing last minute stakeholder changes without giving yourself permission to reset expectations. You do an incredible job staying flexible, but it’s completely OK to slow things down when new constraints appear so the team can regroup and plan intentionally.
### **Keep**
- Building strong relationships with stakeholders and maintaining trust across both government and Rise8 partners.
- Facilitating meetings with clarity, empathy, and a human touch.
- Adjusting priorities quickly based on new mission realities.
- Creating space for honest, human conversation within the team.
- Preparing pre-meetings for high stakes client discussions. These sessions have been extremely valuable.
