**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 3 - Neutral

**Comment**:
> I focus on their growth and remove friction. My team knows I am 100% invested in their professional growth. I make it a priority to find opportunities for them to take on more complex cross-team work or be involved in challenging stakeholder conversations. I believe folks would say I'm a 'blocker-remover.' They trust me to handle the friction and bureaucracy that prevents them from focusing on the delivery of high-quality software.




I provide clarity and autonomy. My team would say I'm consistent in providing the 'why' behind our project and how it maps to the company and client goals. I set a clear vision for what we needed to achieve, and then I trust them with the how, providing only high-level expectations. That autonomy is a key reason we have had such high engagement and strong results since I've been on the project. I offer plenty of pairing time to help hone their skills and discuss practices to deliver results.




I believe my peers on the leadership team would rehire me. They view me as a reliable teammate who is always willing to collaborate for the good of the project, presenting new ideas and methods for getting clarity with the client.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Stop being the lead doer: My current and past success that I fall into is being the one to remove blockers and owned team-level artifacts. I'll be taking a conscious approach to delegating those responsibilities, trusting teams to execute. 
- Start focusing on the health of our entire practice: I'll work to solve any information and alignment problems that exist between the teams and the client, enabling teams to have more centralized sources for decision-making, establishing flexible practice standards for data and refining the cohesive, and compelling narrative that everyone can anchor around. 
- Keep the trust I've built with the team: I want to continue strive to be someone people will willingly follow because I invest in their growth and we're driving towards real mission impact together.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Drove Large-Scale Change by Resolving a Portfolio-Wide Blocker: I distilled complex project issues involving six teams that had blocked progress for my eight-team portfolio for over six months. I worked with the teams to concisely articulate and visualize these dependencies for government and external leadership, connecting the blockers to what we clearly needed from support. Resolving this is enabling all eight teams to deliver on our < 180-day 'outcome in prod' brand promise, reducing the potential time to achieve this goal by 30%.
- Established a Portfolio-Wide Vision to Drive Mission Metrics: I identified that my eight-team portfolio was unsure how their work connected to the client's 'Mission Metrics That Matter' (MMTM). I established a clear vision, strategy, and initial outcomes, scaling this new direction across all 40 practitioners. This has significantly improved project clarity, ensuring all eight teams are now aligned and focused on improving the client's MMTM.
- Scaled Portfolio Performance by Proactively Building Talent: I identified and addressed critical skill gaps across my portfolio by directly coaching and upskilling 6 PMs. I also grew non-traditional PMs by successfully upskilling a designer and a cybersecurity SME on PM skills and placing them in key roles. This strategic talent development, combined with hiring 5 new personnel and actively managing performance expectations for 5 others, was a key driver for my portfolio, improving and accelerating its delivery of successful mission outcomes.

**Comment**:
> Josh is, without exaggeration, one of the best product leaders I have ever worked with. Joining the program mid-stream in August—amidst leadership changes and a mountain of existing documentation—he demonstrated incredible learning velocity. He didn't just read the documentation; he comprehended it and immediately started asking the right questions (we had our first 1:1 within his first few days).
Josh was exactly the stabilizing force the FORGE program needed. He embodies Be Bold by being confident yet openly humble—willing to ask the hard questions that turned rough waters into a culture of elevated trust. He quickly identified gaps in our execution and implemented a new vision and strategy and a consistent project plan, aligning all PMs to a shared definition of success. By establishing the bi-weekly demo, he shifted the conversation from "saying" to "showing," proving that we value outcomes above all else.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep facilitating conversations with that unique balance of commanding the room while ensuring every voice is heard. You are actively creating an idea meritocracy, ensuring we get the best ideas on the table before we decide and commit.
- Keep "min/maxing" (your words) your time and ruthlessly prioritizing. Your ability to pivot as priorities change is uncanny. I have learned a great deal just by watching how you delegate and prioritize; please continue to model this behavior for all of the FORGE teams.
- Keep making the hard choices. Your willingness to identify lack of continuity and drive action to fix it is exactly what's required to ensure the program's success. It is a pleasure working with you to build this team.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Josh's leadership and strategic intent taking over the portfolio have been instrumental in focusing the team's efforts, especially in the face of constant changes to the customer & portfolio and timeline delays. He swiftly addressed the ambiguity of the program's prior state, refocusing teams on core deliverables and establishing a new project plan to bring alignment to the portfolio. By implementing client demos, he both surfaced the value of what the portfolio was building effectively and allowed for individual contributors to get a better sense of the customer, a gap the team had identified.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Continue driving clarity and unity: Your emphasis on formalizing the new project plan, cleaning up the GitHub backlog, and centralizing risk/assumption tracking is vital for overcoming the program's initial disjointedness & ambiguity. This is essential for moving the project towards and keeping alignment.
- Continue giving feedback to your team, especially at an individual level. Your insight and encouragement to the team especially after client interactions is noted & helps motivate and reframe the sentiments productively. Individual feedback, though time-consuming, helps grow the capabilities of the program as a whole.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Prioritize all of the work-steams that you currently operate within, identifying areas that can be delegated elsewhere or cut out completely, making room for deeper focus on the higher priorities. Be more organized for team meetings, setting established targets for the meeting and keeping to strict time boxes.




Stop: Relying on published policy or guidance as a motivator for Riser/team performance. At times, I've heard you reference templates, guidance, checklists, Slack posts with the expectation that Risers are adequately informed. When signals are there that Risers aren't following that guidance, we need to seek out other ways of communicating the expectation or making compliance an easier path for them.




Keep: Objectively telling us all how performance is going. You're exceptional at this. Working hard at giving assertive feedback to members in the portfolio.

> Please **continue** to be that essential voice for structure, strategy, and clarity. Your ability to organize our efforts and streamline communication across the portfolio has been indispensable. I especially value your willingness to pair with others to help them skill up, as well as your concise, direct feedback about your needs and what's not working. That candor is exactly what we need to find solutions and fix problems efficiently. You are already a master at bringing order to complex situations. Please continue to create durable systems that allow *others* to maintain that order. When you identify a problem, consider "what process or template could I create so this doesn't happen again?" By embedding your strategic thinking into our team's regular operations, you can scale your impact even further and help elevate everyone's organizational skills.
