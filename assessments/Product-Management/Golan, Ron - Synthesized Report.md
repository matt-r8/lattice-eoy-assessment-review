Ron has been an absolute pleasure to work with and a tremendous leader and teammate. 




I've been lucky enough to have Ron as a PM on two separate efforts, and in both, he has done a tremendous job managing priorities, leading the team, and coordinating with stakeholders. 




He is personable, smart, and honest. He approaches problems with an open mindset and makes sure everyone is on the same page. He prioritizes learning, and has shown the ability to learn complex subjects and domains in a short amount of time. 




I would love to see Ron in a leadership role as I think he is that good.

<details>

**Stefan Tanenbaum:**
Ron has been an absolute pleasure to work with and a tremendous leader and teammate. 




I've been lucky enough to have Ron as a PM on two separate efforts, and in both, he has done a tremendous job managing priorities, leading the team, and coordinating with stakeholders. 




He is personable, smart, and honest. He approaches problems with an open mindset and makes sure everyone is on the same page. He prioritizes learning, and has shown the ability to learn complex subjects and domains in a short amount of time. 




I would love to see Ron in a leadership role as I think he is that good.

**Jeremy Arzuaga:**
It's only been 2 months working with Ron, but overall he's been a pleasure to work with. He was dropped into a pretty difficult domain and has taken it upon himself to learn it (cATO SME as some would say).

**Coby Almond:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Ron because he successfully navigates the ambiguity of high-complexity engagements. On ACE, he has adapted quickly to the unique challenge of merging a Discovery & Framing engagement with a technical cATO implementation. He embodies **Do What Works** by helping the team pivot from theoretical goals to scoping a tractable 'thin slice' and identifying the 'durable thing' that will provide leverage for future security work. Additionally, his ability to **Always Be Kind** is a superpower in this environment; he has been exceptionally patient with stakeholders who are under intense pressure, preserving critical relationships. He is a strong interviewer and a steady partner in discovery, proving he can move fast and stay flexible even when the next step isn't immediately clear.

**Jodie Nkansah:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Ron as a Senior Product Manager because Ron consistently models high standards of performance and integrity. Ron is great in his core responsibilities as a product manager, delivering transformative results while operating with accountability. He ensure successful execution in production and takes on the tasks of gathering data for submitting outcomes in prod and supporting outcomes and clearly communicating the impacts of those outcomes to stakeholders. Ron models transparency and clarity when communicating priorities and risks to stakeholders and providing feedback.

**Paul Fretz:**
Ron is an incredible PM. I’ve really enjoyed working with him, and I’m genuinely sad that I won’t be working with him moving forward. He was excellent at writing outcomes, driving toward them, and clearly representing the work our team delivered. He was also strong at setting priorities and refining our roadmap. Ron consistently sought feedback—both from the team and from our tenants—to understand how we were doing and where we could improve. He was very user-focused, frequently gathering input on the tools we built and refining the golden path based on that feedback.

**Coty Allen:**
Ron was a great person to bring into checkpoints to make sure we had program-level alignment and to ensure the Rise8 teams were working together.

**KEEP:**

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Stefan Tanenbaum:**
I would love to see Ron continue to chip away at gaining more technical prowess. While he is a cATO SME, I think there's a complimentary technical layer that could be added on to that knowledge.




Ron should keep being an outstanding teammate and leader.

**Jeremy Arzuaga:**
Ron is really great at getting the team thinking about goals with each interaction with have with our users and stakeholders. He's ambitious with them too which really drives the team to moving quickly while also making sure it doesn't hinder the quality specifically with the preliminary mid point contextual report. He's been great at leaning on others when necessary, and I admire that he's not afraid to let people know when he doesn't know a thing. He's built a great relationship with our PO where verbally said "he trust us" in a really short amount of time. 




Over the next few months I think it's going to be crucial for us to continue to figure out how to best integrate with the organization, make sure we're not operating in a silo, and we're utilizing the entire team (6 engineers is a lot!)

**Jodie Nkansah:**
Keep acting as the indispensable owner of outcomes. Your ability to transparently communicate risks and priorities and provide a voice to the impact of solutions is essential. You also have a keen ability to identify supporting outcomes, making sure that no team accomplishment goes unrecognized. Keep shielding teams from unnecessary busy work so teams can maintain focus on high-leverage deliverables. Stop viewing yourself as just a facilitator for the team. Given your demonstrated strategic impact, high integrity, and influence on teams, you should recognize your leadership capacity and impact. Start providing proactive, unsolicited feedback to teammates. Your feedback is incredibly valuable when requested, and your insights would be even more impactful when shared proactively.

**Paul Fretz:**
**Start** – Nothing really comes to mind. I don’t have any complaints.
**Stop** – Sometimes Ron can overanalyze a problem or situation.
**Keep** – Keep crushing it. I know ACE will be successful, and you’ll be a big part of that. Ron is excellent at communicating with leadership and navigating a wide range of personalities, and he should continue leveraging those strengths.

**Coty Allen:**
Keep:  Pushing to get those people that don't have easy Outcomes in Production to be equally graded with those that do.
