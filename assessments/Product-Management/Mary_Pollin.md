### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired because I have consistently demonstrated the core traits of an A Player in my full-time tenure, particularly my commitment to rapid learning, organizational alignment, and proactive problem-solving.




Upon starting full-time in September, I immediately absorbed a highly difficult knowledge space (RMF and Tracer) to provide immediate, high-quality coverage for Dave's parental leave. This rapid acquisition of technical and domain knowledge ensured seamless continuity for the Tracer team and prevented any loss of momentum on the product roadmap, allowing Dave to focus on his family. This exhibits high accountability and ownership thinking.




Furthermore, when the Tracer team faced strategic roadblocks, I led a decisive pivot where I proactively reworked our team milestones and epics. I took actions to ensure strong alignment with the broader FORGE portfolio team and immediately initiate work on the new eMASS-interoperability focus. This decisive action, taken without needing excessive management, is the essence of an employee who drives outcomes and growth. My current rapid transition onto the FORGE SecRel team continues this pattern of continual learning and growth mindset, ensuring the mission's long-term success, as I have worked to learn a highly technical area in a short amount of time.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep Doing: I will keep prioritizing rapid domain learning and proactive information-seeking. The speed at which I learned RMF, Tracer, and began integrating into the SecRel space is a critical asset. I will sustain the habit of engaging directly with Subject Matter Experts (SMEs) and reaching out to relevant POCs to continuously refine product alignment and requirements, ensuring we are always working on the right things.
- Stop Doing: I plan to stop focusing on reactive mitigation of low-priority, externally-driven blockers. Instead, I will dedicate more time to strategic foresight and internal process optimization on the SecRel team, ensuring I am anticipating technical and alignment challenges and creating solutions before they become blockers.
- Start Doing: I will start dedicating time for technical deep dives with the FORGE SecRel engineers. Given the highly technical nature of this product, I need to deepen my technical fluency beyond the RMF/governance layer to better weigh development risks and opportunities, which will strengthen my ability to Keep it Real with the team and stakeholders.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Led Strategic Pivot for Tracer Product Alignment: As the PM for Tracer, I led the strategic pivot to focus the product on eMASS integration, directly aligning development efforts with the FORGE portfolio's long-term authorization goals. This action mitigated the risk of continued development on a non-viable path, ensuring that all current and future engineering effort is concentrated on a high-value outcome that will ultimately enable the team's mission.
2. Provided High-Quality, Seamless Coverage for Tracer PM: Within weeks of being hired full-time, I absorbed complex RMF and Tracer product knowledge to cover Dave's parental leave. The impact of this accomplishment was ensuring zero loss of momentum on the Tracer roadmap and providing high assurance to the team and leadership that the product was fully covered, exemplifying my dedication to the team and mission.
3. Transition to SecRel PM: I successfully executed a rapid transition to the SecRel team, absorbing the complex, SecRel domain knowledge and its integration into the FORGE architecture in a short timeframe. This rapid knowledge acquisition demonstrated grit and an intense growth mindset, enabling me to achieve immediate operational contribution. Furthermore, I proactively leveraged this new domain understanding by initiating the development of user stories for Epic 8, ensuring seamless forward momentum and aligning future work with key strategic objectives.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I strongly agree that I would enthusiastically rehire Mary. She demonstrated incredible **Grit** and **Courage** by stepping in to backfill me during my parental leave. Despite having very little domain knowledge or transfer time, Mary 'Did What Was Required' to keep the team moving forward through a phase of high uncertainty. She faced a steep learning curve with zero complaints and represented the product with excellence—even presenting confidently to the CEO. Her calm, even temperament provided stability for the team when they needed it most. She performed at the level of a Senior PM, proving she can thrive in ambiguity.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing:**
- **Being Bold in Ambiguity:** You jumped into the Tracer product with almost no context and "stepped up to the plate" immediately. Your ability to execute without needing perfect information is a superpower. Keep seeking out those uncomfortable challenges.
- **Maintaining Grace Under Pressure:** Your calm, even temperament was exactly what the team needed during the transition. You never let the stress of the "high uncertainty" phase affect your interactions.
- **Stakeholder Presence:** You represented the product beautifully, including your presentation to the CEO. Keep projecting that confidence.
**Start Doing:**
- **Seeking out "Turnaround" or "Zero-to-One" opportunities:** You proved you don't need a warm handover to succeed. I’d like to see you start positioning yourself for initiatives that require high adaptability, as you have a natural aptitude for organizing chaos.
- **Trusting your instincts as a Senior PM:** You operated at a senior level during this backfill. Start owning that authority in every room you walk into—you have earned the right to lead complex products.
**Stop Doing:**
- **Hesitating to take the lead (if you ever do):** You tackled a role with the odds stacked against you and succeeded without complaint. Stop worrying (if you ever do) about whether you have enough "tenure" or "domain expertise" to speak up—your performance proved that your product instincts are spot on.

**Comment**:
> Mary is a strong PM who excellently kept things running on the Tracer team while Dave was out. Despite the fairly short handoff period and the depth of our domain, Mary took on the challenge calmly and performed incredibly well. She is open about what she doesn't know and when she needs support, and took every opportunity to learn from and leverage her teammates to ensure the entire team succeeds. Mary fit right into the team's culture, and brought her own friendly and fun personality into the mix.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep leaning on your teammates when you need support; for some people it can be a struggle to check their ego and admit that they need help, but you were candid with the team when you needed engineering support on the drumbeats. Even though you're no longer on the team, this new activity from engineering has continued to prove valuable to the team - showing what an enduring impact one open person can have on team rituals and performance!
- Start asserting yourself more in meetings; while you likely understandably felt like the green horn on Tracer, your perspective is still valuable and you should strive to speak up and make your presence felt.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Mary did an excellent job stepping in as the interim Product Manager for Tracer. She faced an incredibly steep learning curve—simultaneously navigating the vast RMF domain, understanding the Tracer product, and onboarding to the FORGE environment. Despite this complexity, she absorbed the context rapidly, allowing her to effectively create and prioritize stories and make tangible contributions to development in a very short window. Most importantly, she didn't just 'keep the lights on'; she managed the transition perfectly, leaving the team organized and positioned to succeed after her departure.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Mary should start treating her ability to learn complex domains (like RMF) as a teachable skill. She onboarded remarkably fast in a hostile complexity environment. For her next role, she should start documenting *how* she digests information so quickly, as that 'discovery framework' would be valuable to other PMs entering new Rise8 engagements.




Stop: Mary should stop feeling the pressure to understand *every* nuance of a technical domain before making prioritization calls. In deep technical fields like RMF, it is impossible to know it all. She has good instincts; she can trust the engineers on the technical 'how' so she can focus earlier on the product 'what.' She doesn't need to be a subject matter expert to be an effective PM.




Keep: She should keep her focus on clean transitions and stewardship. Temporary PMs often leave a mess of half-finished thoughts, but Mary ensured the backlog was healthy and the team was prepared for her exit. That 'leave it better than you found it' attitude is rare and incredibly high-value for consulting/rotational work.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Mary because she demonstrated an incredible ability to ramp up and take ownership in a short period of time. Although she was only on the team from September to November, she partnered with our designer, Alex, to navigate a very complicated domain and was quickly leading team meetings and attending stakeholder interactions. This surprised me given her short tenure, but she took responsibility and action which was a great asset to the team. She presented to our CEO, Bryon, and did a fantastic job fielding questions which resulted in positive feedback and clear action items for the team. She also took charge of leading team ceremonies like Pre-IPM and IPM and was effective at interfacing with external teams to get answers. All the while she remained open to discussing ideas with team members and was receptive to feedback.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Relying on engineers to answer technical questions during presentations. During the presentation to Bryon, she was asked a technical question that she didn't know the answer to; she should feel free to call on engineers to answer the question without fear.




Stop: I can’t see anything that she should stop doing as she did a great job during her short time on the team.




Keep: Applying the same initiative and drive to grow into a domain and taking responsibility in meetings. Now that she is on another team, maintaining this proactive approach will be invaluable for her and inspire confidence in her new team as she ramps up again.

Even though she was on Tracer for a short time and knew the duration from the start, she invested her all and didn't yield. She has the undeniable grit to acclimate to uncertain and new environments. When Dave went on parental leave, she took on an enormous workload and knocked it out of the park. Even handing off to-do lists of tasks for Dave to pick up instead of vanishing when he returned.




Her greatest strengths are her active listening and her ability to leverage others—she knew exactly how to lean on the design team and her engineers to build her own understanding and get the job done. I have no doubt she will always do the right thing and get rid of unnecessary rules.

I am interested in seeing you establish more tenacity. I acknowledge that without knowledge/experience within a heavy domain like Tracer, boldness may err in appearing like totalitarian arrogance. So no discredit there. Your soft spoken nature is a strength in many ways, but will also yield its own challenges in contrast.
