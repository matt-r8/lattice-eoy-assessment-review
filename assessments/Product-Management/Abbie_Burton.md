### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would rehire me as a product manager because I bring strong leadership, strategic clarity, and a consistent focus on mission impact, while also creating a collaborative and fun team environment. As a trailblazer on Warp Core, I helped establish foundational processes, delivered Vue "Milestone 1", and created a scalable path-to-prod that other teams now use. I pair this technical and process leadership with solid product fundamentals—building clear outcome-oriented roadmaps, VSMs, and impact maps, and grounding decisions in real user insights gathered through effective research. I also enable my teammates by preparing them for successful user engagement and driving meaningful improvements based on pain points. My initiative, collaboration, technical curiosity, and user-centered approach make me a reliable partner and someone my teammates would confidently rehire.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- I will begin the OA process early, recognizing that it will take significant time, and I plan to learn as much as possible from Blitzar’s experience to ensure a smoother/quicker path.
- I will plan to conduct another site visit to validate and measure Vue's future state on WarpCore and deepen our understanding of additional user needs that are not included in the MVP.
### **Continue**
- I will continue gaining more technical context around Polars as we re-write the algorithm so I can better support decision-making and ensure alignment between technical and product perspectives.
- I will continue updating the outcome-oriented roadmap and VSM as I learn more, ensuring they remain accurate, actionable, and tied to mission impact.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Trailblazer on Warp Core**
   - I served as an early pathfinder for WarpCore, helping establish clarity and processes that enabled our team and ultimately other teams to succeed. Malibu created the initial P2P process for WC so we had a functional starting point but it wasn't perfect. We finalized the WC Marketplace P2P using the traditional ARR process, collaborating with the platform team, to optimize the process, which included a comprehensive P2P guide for other teams to follow. Once additional teams adopt this new WC P2P process, we will be able to submit a strong supporting outcome.
   - As part of our delivery milestones, Malibu completed Vue "Milestone 1", which is everything leading up to running the algorithm (matching the SCCs with sites) and successfully deployed the WC Marketplace app from IL4 to IL6. We connected to two new data sources that are now automated and reliable, significantly improving the user experience by eliminating their previously manual process for retrieving this data. We also cataloged the full Vue algorithm to ensure we had a complete understanding before re-writing it on WC. Through this analysis, we identified two viable approaches for rewriting the algorithm (Polars-based Python Transforms vs. Compute Modules) and presented them to Anthony. Pending a successful Polars proof of concept, this approach will not only allow us to migrate the algorithm, but also significantly improve its performance.
- **Product Leader in S31**
   - As Malibu's product manager I iterated on our outcome oriented roadmap, VSM and impact maps up to meet Rise8's standards. I shared our VSM with the other S31 teams, walking them through how we successfully approached the process, including best practices and lessons learned, so they could replicate and adapt it for their own products.
   - I conducted an in-person site visit to NSDC in September, where we gathered baseline metrics on the current Vue experience on the KM platform and demoed the future state of Vue on WC. I reviewed and updated the VSM with our customer's input. Based on insights from that visit, I also refined Malibu's Impact Map, and Roadmap and gathered the context needed to craft a more meaningful mission impact statement. I also secured user-driven prioritization for upcoming features, ensuring our roadmap reflects real operational needs.
   - Additionally, I prepared Frank and Alex for a second site visit in October which focused on validating Vue’s "Milestone 1" implementation on WC and meeting with Maj Matt Holland to better understand organizational measures of success. Because of the structure, content, and context I provided, they were able to confidently conduct all necessary research on our behalf. The insights from this visit allowed me to thoughtfully de-scope several items from the MVP based on direct user feedback, keeping the product focused, deliverable, and aligned with mission impact.
   - In addition to driving Vue’s migration from KM to Warp Core, we also delivered meaningful enhancements based on the pain points uncovered during our first site visit. We resolved the issue with the “Load TLE” button on Vue in KM and successfully transitioned the backend data connection from the failing UDL source to a reliable data source on WC. Users have validated that the updated functionality works as intended, and we will be submitting an outcome in production for this enhancement.
- **PM/PD Offsite Planning**
   - I was selected to join the planning team for the PM/PD Offsite and played a key role in ensuring the event’s success. I helped determine the location, researched and selected the optimal hotel, and contributed to shaping the agenda, organizing speakers, coordinating meals and arranging networking events. The offsite, which hosted 38 Risers, went off without a hitch. We received significant positive feedback on the curated learning sessions and the value of collaborating in person, reflecting the impact of our thorough preparation and thoughtful design.

**Comment**:
> Abbie is the portfolio's most trustworthy and reliable PM who consistently spearheads portfolio initiatives while ensuring her team delivers on their responsibilities in an organized and timely fashion. I especially commend her ability to grow the sense of urgency and engagement among the SPA developers on her team - I have noticed a visible improvement over the past year and I know it has been a focus of hers and not the easiest undertaking. She keeps a cool calm head about unexpected changes and approaches every new challenge with a smile.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep working on growing your understanding of your product's domain in regard to the impact it provides to the broader mission of Space C2. I know it has been somewhat of a difficult rewiring process for you to really try to understand the "why" vs the "what" and you have done a great job putting in the time and effort to broaden your understanding. I would love to see over the next year this new mission focused mindset become your default when approaching any product or conversation, since I think that will really level you up as a master of the domain versus a manager of the process to which you have been assigned.




As a follow on to that, one suggestion is to start focusing more on storytelling when presenting your product or meeting with users and stakeholders. Being able to evangelize your product, an experiment, or an outcome - big or small, internal or external - is a superpower when it comes to building trust with users, stakeholders, and team members. I know I have given some feedback on this in the past, but some of your demos and presentations can feel a little too much like a rehash of the content on the screen which can come across as somebody having put words in your mouth versus you speaking directly from your knowledge with passion and enthusiasm. I'd love to see more of a cohesive narrative that can reference the content being presented but expands upon it instead of relying on it (if that distinction makes sense). I think the first step is to deeply understand and believe the content (which you're working on), and by doing so your confidence and understanding will come across more clearly and make all types of presentations and conversations more engaging, believable, and trust-building. I hope that feedback makes sense since it's a little tricky to articulate, but for an actionable first step maybe practicing demos of your app or VSM or recent learnings without any visual aids could force you to rely more on your personal narrative. This is a tricky but IMO enormously valuable skill, so I'm happy to pair on it more and provide feedback where I can

**Comment**:
> Abbie has continued to do a great job of breaking down work in a way that keeps the team focused and empowered to keep continuously delivering, despite the ambiguous nature of the Warp Core migration. Setting up a site visit with the NSDC users must have been an incredibly insightful experience for the team, especially since they were also dealing with onboarding a new designer at the time. The timing would've hopefully allowed the designer to onboard even quicker onto the team. Abbie also collaborated on important artifacts with the users, like the value stream map, which allowed the team to understand the bigger picture of their work directly with the users. Abbie keeps the team moving even during times of uncertainty and is integral leader to them.

**Comment**:
> - **Keep** continuing to spread your influence within Section31, especially as the more experienced product manager and with non-Rise8 members. If the Malibu team is still the furthest ahead on the migration effort, it's a great opportunity to share learnings with other teams we well.
