<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. **Delivered a 70% Reduction in Cognitive Load for TAK Operators**
Led the product strategy for the TAK competition, driving a focus on outcomes over outputs. By prioritizing precision and streamlining sequencing of markers, I led the team to build a solution that reduced the number of required user interactions by 70% compared to the legacy workflow, achieving 90% precision on the key imagery provided by the Government. Directly supporting the mission where we create a future where fewer bad things happen because of bad software. By reducing the cognitive burden on the operator, I minimized the risk of human error in a high-stress environment, proving that softtwre can be both powerful and simple.
2. **Protected the Value Stream by Realigning Stakeholders**
In the final week of the competition, I boldly pushed back against stakeholder requests for new features to focus on the Swipe to Sequence logic. I identified that this specific feature was not where we needed to be and was the critical path to tactical utility (direction and distance) and successfully rallied the team to ship this instead of other nice-to-have features like capturing user corrections to improve our model or exporting in GeoPDF.
3. **Exercised High Agency to Prioritize Mission Success Over Standard Process**
Supported engineers in their controversial but strategic decision to overfit the AI model to government satellite imagery, violating standard data science norms to maximize performance within the constraints of the competition. I validated the risk by checking performance against non Government Furnished Imagery and proceeded because it was the best path to winning.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Kevan Mordan:**
Yi is very dedicated and rigorous which is both his greatest asset and weakness. When Yi is on course, he gets far down the right path; when Yi is off course, he gets far but not down the right path. I applaud the zeal, but this can cause unintentional team friction and misalignment, especially coupled with Yi's tendency to go completely heads down for a period of time. I say this because fundamentally Yi has the makings of a standout PM and small adjustments can really unlock Yi's potential.

**Jonathan Van Dalen:**
Working with Yi on the TAK 9-week prototype, I saw his strong organizational skill and ability to persevere, moving fast towards milestones. Yi helped the team to organize strong, specific delivery milestones and ensured we were all marching to the same beat. Yi was able to retain enough structure while allowing the team lots of trust and flexibility to just "go" and get things researched, figured out, and created.

**Noah McHugh:**
Yi is the perfect example of how a PM should be, he is on top of everything, asks the right questions, and tracks you down when you need to be tracked down. He is a joy to work with and I can trust in his abilities when working with him, never need to worry if things are being kept together.

**Sharon Hamilton:**
Yis ability to adjust to whatever dynamic he is facing is commendable. He is a strong PM who brings structure to his teams efforts and enables faster decision making that is aligned with the product vision and customer mission.

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Kevan Mordan:**
Start - communicating more with team




Keep - Grit and resolve, you put in the time and effort and it really pays off




Stop - waiting until you have finished the entire first draft of a product/deliverable before showing it to the team (feels like flipping the table)

**Jonathan Van Dalen:**
Keep: encouraging a fast, organized pace, more definition and validation early on. Keep collaborating on features with the team and pairing with design to flesh out the storytelling and meaning of the solution.




Stop: not really a "stop" but I would just encourage Yi to stop the team when necessary to come together and collaborate/problem solve more, when needed, so that we have alignment and discussion even if things seem to be moving fast/time is tight.




Start: even more focus on outcome and metrics, measuring and telling a story of behavior/outcome change and mission impact. While we accomplished this (and a lot more) with TAK, it would have been cleaner to finish the measurement and  refine story telling around it.

**Noah McHugh:**
Keep up your attention to detail, you make sure nothing is missed and that is such an incredibly important trait.

**Sharon Hamilton:**
Keep brining your technical experience and PM standards to your team. Continue developing your communication skills.
