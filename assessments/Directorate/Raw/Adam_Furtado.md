### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I think there is strong alignment between our values and how I operate.  The places that I can improve are on ensuring that I don't create unnecessary rules on my team (I do tend to do that)- and in ensuring everything we are doing is in service to Outcomes in Production.  I believe that is true today, but I haven't been able to validate that yet- the rating will go up with time. I have long feedback loops.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: 
- I have a hyper-talented team. The Enablement Team likely has the most talent density in the company and I want to raise the level even further. At this point I have bene building trust with the team. I've certainly been giving feedback, but there are opportunities for me to hold people accountable to raising their performance even further.
- We are introducing a number of projects and initiatives for the company. I need to make sure each is being measured to ensure that we getting the requisite ROI for each.




Stop:
- I've been a little worried about stepping on people's toes.  The more I think about it, as potentially the only other person in the company that has been a founder (is that true?), I think I have a different level of urgency than some of my peers. Instead of passively providing opinions, I want to force the issue a little more and hold my peers accountable to what we need as a business. I also need to do that in the right way. <- would be interested in your thoughts around this.




Keep:
Keep creating creative space for the team to build!

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Led and supported DL/PL/EL transition
- Owned OKR2 for 4Q. This led to creating products and processes that will streamline comms in the company
- Leading big picture, long-term initiatives, highlighting my potential as a strategic partner on our executive team long term

**Comment**:
> I'm admittedly basing some of my assessment here on my knowledge of you from past experiences, and it's worth noting that in the areas where I've been able to see you here at Rise8, you've grown incredibly. You came into the org really strong and I'm excited to see where you take things.




On No Unnecessary Rules it's interesting... if you had asked me in 2019 on my way out, I would have said you were almost a no rules/structure guy... not even the necessary ones. I know around the time I left you were already getting frustrated with how that was playing out. I remember one comment to the JTT related teams that was something like, "Stop with all the discovery and just build a replacement already." That was a long time ago. Totally making assumptions, but I wonder if that experience has you overrotating on structure in some areas?  We should talk more about that. The unnecessary structure I'm most concerned about is managers, but there are many other things that have come along in the past that seem like they should be solved with rules/overhead that could just be solved with personal responsibility, etc.  




Another thing to be careful about would be kindness... or at least the perception of it. Sometimes your approach to debate (tone, sarcasm, etc) can be really off putting. I can point it out when I see it. It's something I've gotten pretty used to and also know your intent... but not all your teammates have. 




Last is outcomes focus... we're both guilty of being ideas guys and getting lost in the vision and hyping things up. I'm actually kinda worried about that when it's just the two of us working on something. Need to get more disciplined about outcomes. But heard on your feedback re: future vs. current optimizations. The outcomes are fuzzy 2-3 years out, but we should still try to tie investments and initiatives back to what matters.




I think you get pretty regular feedback from me, but it might be worth checking in before mid year, since we don't have much to go on yet!

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: 1) Challenging things. I know there have been a couple times (at least) where it probably felt like I was annoyed. And I was! But that's good tension that will serve Rise8 well. It's great having you back. 2) Giving hype speeches about the future. As noted above, we have to anchor in outcomes, but you have a real gift for getting people excited about the future.
Stop: Taking on too much. I think you're already doing it. Maybe I'm misjudging, but I'm very worried about it. It's ok to let some things burn. I've let some burn for five years. Sometimes I get that decision wrong. But it's always better than when I've tried to do everything. Unlimited problems vs Limited resources.
I don't have any starts just yet... as I noted, you might need to stop a lot before you even think about starting new things. Maybe the start is a bit more ruthless prioritization?

**Comment**:
> You're the best at providing feedback and advice when I need it most. I appreciate how you can directly cut through company-wide issues to get to the core of where the problem lives and start navigating solutions to it.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Demonstrating how Enablement Dept is providing value to the rest of the company. Show us where are the items from enablement saving cycles, burden, workload from other Risers, if possible. Understanding that not all of enablement projects are for that purpose.




Stop: "Waiting your turn" to speak or being afraid to ruffle feathers. I believe that you see organizational signals before most, call them out directly and specifically when you see them.




Keep: Your passion high, it shows every time you get a chance to discuss what your bigger plans are for enablement. Keep looking for ways to improve things across other departments as well; very few people in the company have experience running an entire company, so you see things most of us do not.

**Rating**: 3 - Neutral

**Comment**:
> Excited to have your department stood up and have you on board.  What I would love to see as we have new director roles is a sense of curiosity for what's been tried already, exactly what problems need to be solved and when, and how to best leverage the brains around them.  Especially for people with history related to Rise8, it may be easy to make assumptions about what to do and why, and I'd encourage identifying and checking those assumptions as we all charge hard ahead.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> "Enablement" is obviously pretty broad, and I'm interested to see how you're going to share all the activities/outputs of your team, especially for the items that different roles can leverage.  For example, developing Ship Summit will be a pretty obvious result, but I'm hearing of lots of good work from people like Matt but am not sure what I need to be aware of or what might impact other departments.
I know there was an intention for you to help with workshops/customer shaping, and I'm curious when that falls on your roadmap and what you're envisioning (and/or how you plan to work with others to develop that vision).

**Comment**:
> I have really super appreciated having you join Rise8 full-time. You are a feedback savant and have been able to get folks feedback in a kind, data-driven way to help us iterate for the better as an organization. You are pragmatic, thoughtful, self-aware and embody all of our Rise8 values. I've really enjoyed being on the enablement team and being able to collaborate with you.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Continue: Continue asking for feedback and putting feedback mechanisms in place. It's the first time I've been doing weekly retros since joining Rise8 (crazy to believe) and it's helping our new team work better together and work through the challenges around standing up a new department.




Continue: Trusting the experts around you and not trying to put unnecessary rules in place which would add bloat/slow down our work




Start: I think it would help me (probably others too?) to have a bit of guidance around priorities - especially things which require support from other people. We just took on this new process for content approvals - how should folks be balancing that alongside building Perform8 or the work to support GitLab rollout? I don't think we need anything heavy handed here, even some general guidance / stack rank of initiative priorities for a given week would help.

> I haven't spent a ton of time with Adam since he is newer to Rise8, but I value his passion and vision for where we are heading, as well as his bias for action and low tolerance for things that are waisting time. So far I believe we made a great choice in picking Adam up!

**Comment**:
> **Start**
1. Q425' is intentionally messy. In 26' I want our team to be ruthlessly prioritizing and over communicating our priorities that are tied to clear, measurable, goals so that we limit distractions and deliver as much value as possible.
**Stop**
1. Can't think of anything at the moment
**Continue**
1. Synchronous meetings you've implemented and that have increased engagement, learning, and improvement
2. Aligning our strengths towards the greatest opportunity to affect Rise8 critical numbers like outcomes in prod and revenue
