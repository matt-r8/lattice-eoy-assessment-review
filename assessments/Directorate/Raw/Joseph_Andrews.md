**Rating**: 3 - Solid Performer

### Question 6
**Keep it Real: I keep it real with teammates and myself about not only impact and outcomes, but also the risks and opportunities along the way, leading indicators (pivots when needed), and take full ownership of the results without making excuses or shifting blame.**

**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 7
**Outcomes in Production: I ship/support outcomes in production.**

**Rating**: 3 - Solid Performer

### Question 8

**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 10
**No Unnecessary Rules: I am very comfortable in a high agency environment, and don’t seek or try to implement unnecessary rules.**

**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I would be rehired because I consistently deliver against high-growth hiring targets (89 offers accepted on the year) while protecting delivery capacity and employee experience. I strive to keep our candidate pipeline healthy , sustain an offer-acceptance rate in the low-90s, and move quickly to close critical skill gaps (PMs, SMEs, platform roles and contingent 1099s). At the same time I lead cross-functional projects — benefits transitions, EOY assessments, GovCon101 content build, and I'm alway eager to take on news challenges. I believe that this helps reduce cost, improve operational clarity, and make our teams more effective. I show up as a pragmatic partner to Delivery, Finance, Enablement, Growth and Customer Success: I own problems, follow through on fixes, and build repeatable processes so teams can focus on mission outcomes.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- Launch the TAP + Pod model (promote Darrell to TAP; hire 2 top-of-funnel recruiters) to create predictable top-of-funnel capacity for Delivery projects.
- Automate Greenhouse reporting and roll out a weekly hiring scorecard for Delivery Leads and Finance (time-to-fill, pipeline depth, source effectiveness).
- Formalize interviewer calibration and a light interview certification program (reduce variance in interview outcomes).
- Move GovCon101 into a piloted learning path (Rippling Course Builder) and scale volunteer authors via structured templates.
Stop
- Attempting to be both strategic People Ops lead and the sole full-cycle recruiter for delivery hiring — that’s a bottleneck.
- Relying on manual spreadsheets for headcount forecasting or ad-hoc comms for benefits and EOY processes.
Keep
- High touch candidate & stakeholder communication 
- Pipeline discipline (maintain ≥110% coverage) and offer quality (sustain ~92–93% acceptance).
- Maintain Close relationships with Delivery

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Kept hiring velocity and quality during rapid growth
Delivered benefits and vendor transitions communications to employees
Launched people-ops programs that scale knowledge and performance

He's always flexible and can find ways to continue to push on when we hit roadblocks. I've also seen Joe spend time trying to grow and level up our people ops practices bringing in new concepts to how we approach hiring, interviewing and evaluation.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: It would help me in my role if I knew I had a consistent place I could look to understand a current snapshot of our talent pipeline and up-to-date information for everyone. We have a google spreadsheet but information in there can be outdated and hard to keep track of who has offers, who is at what stage of the interview process, and who dropped out of the pipeline taking a job elsewhere.
Stop: Can't think of anything
Keep: Keep putting the candidates first. You are thoughtful and don't make unnecessary rules - it allows us to bring in the right talent for roles.

> Joe continues to be one of the most reliable and values-aligned leaders in the organization. He has built the People Ops and recruiting function from the ground up, consistently delivers at a high level, and leads with a rare blend of kindness, grit, and integrity. His impact on candidate experience, team morale, and organizational execution is undeniable. As he continues to build confidence in his voice and bring his insights more boldly into leadership-level conversations, I believe his influence will expand even further. Joe is a high-output, high-character leader I would enthusiastically rehire.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Comment**:
> **Start sharing more of your perspective in senior-leader settings.**
From what I’ve observed, your insights are thoughtful and often spot-on. Bringing your voice forward a bit more visibly (even when the room is full of strong personalities ) would add meaningful value.




### **Keep leading with kindness and approachability.**
The way you treat people across all levels is consistently warm and supportive. It sets an important tone for the organization and makes People Ops a safe and trusted space.
### **Keep delivering with reliability and grit.**
Your ability to execute at a high level, especially under pressure, is something the company depends on. The consistency you bring is one of your greatest strengths.
### **Keep embracing learning and feedback with openness.**
Your curiosity and willingness to grow are noticeable, and they’ve contributed to the evolution of People Ops. This mindset is a huge asset and will continue to serve the organization well.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> - Never shies away from giving or receiving feedback - love that you are always direct and clear
- Always keeps us honest when it comes to maintaining company culture, and higher degrees of integrity during hiring or firing situations
- Theres no doubt that Joe can handle high stress situations and finding a way to crush it as a team of one - He's come through for us several times already. However, I worry that the heroism is no longer sustainable for our current company size, and as our company grows/changes we're seeing that our existing people operational processes, policies and systems are beginning to break down. I believe available capacity is real risk to what I'm about to say, but I'd love to see Joe be more proactive with maturing People Ops and HR related capabilities, so that other departments can focus more on their primary objectives.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
- Prioritizing and blocking off time for business case development, and continuous improvement initiatives that help scale People Ops and HR capabilities
**Stop**
- None at this time
**Continue**
- Being candid, concise, and kind

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser because he consistently shows up, gets things done, and keeps our people operations running smoothly. He handles a lot on his own, stays organized, and keeps things moving even when the workload is heavy. He even jumps in on his days off when something urgent needs attention, which really shows his passion and dedication. He communicates clearly, treats everyone with respect, and makes hiring and onboarding feel easy for the rest of us. He’s reliable, steady, and a huge part of why things run as well as they do.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
Start setting clearer boundaries for yourself. You’re incredibly dedicated, but you deserve time to unplug. Giving yourself real downtime will help you stay energized and avoid burnout.
**Stop:**
Stop taking everything on alone. You handle so much, and it’s okay to let others help so you’re not carrying the whole load by yourself.
**Keep:**
Keep bringing the same passion, consistency, and care you show every day. You take on a huge amount of work and still show up for people even on your days off. That level of dedication keeps things running and makes a big difference for the whole team.

Stop: Trusting the process for initial vetting. Raise the bar for candidates to make it through initial vetting and into the actual interview pipeline. This can include rigorous top grading interviews and several reference checks.




Keep: Objectively telling the other directors and company leaders what you need to be successful.
