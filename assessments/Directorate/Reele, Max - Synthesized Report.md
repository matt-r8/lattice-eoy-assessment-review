## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

I recognize that this is an annual look, but at this time I have been at the company for 3 months.




1. Setting the conditions for delivery at scale: I have established a structure within the delivery department to allow our portfolios/teams to continue to scale without needing to grow any more department level leadership. As we gain new teams to portfolio levels of client engagement, we'll involve Delivery Leads to lead delivery in those domains, but keep the department overhead neutral. Once appropriately competent in their leadership and domain context, this also affords for the empowerment for decision making at a central location to where the work is being executed for the users/customers.




2. We are just coming into having the alignment of our individual & team reviews/appraisals match with our company objectives. The A Player assessment scorecards with outcomes in prod and other key metrics being heavily weighted, will drive delivery behavior through ICs, Delivery Leads, and department leadership. This also helps with reinforcing our department priorities of making all of our work visible (backlog visibility to drive transparency of progress on outcomes-oriented roadmaps) and making all of our performance visible (A player assessments for all Risers to know where they stand and how to improve).




3. I drove coordination across departments for important objectives. Some examples include:
- Integrated the company-wide process flow for customer experience through all departments. The sharing of this product to all Risers opens an understanding of company dynamics and how best to support left & right of their primary efforts.
- Worked with Growth and Enablement to push for VSM workshops into the sales cycle, especially pre-contract award. This is to set our delivery teams up with the greatest chance of success via an outcomes-oriented roadmap, appropriate domain knowledge, and a strongly informed & committed customer fit.
- Established the TPM and Gitlab rollout plans/expectations for driving consistency and transparency of performance in delivery teams.
- Worked with Marketing to push for a partnership showcase with Palantir at the Spacepower Conference panel that we're hosting.
- Set the employee expectation in the delivery department that all Risers will lean more heavily into becoming higher competency in technical areas, and now providing the enablement to do so respective of the company AI mandate. Worked with Enablement to help drive AI adoption through workshops and infrastructure rollout, which is still a work in progress but Lightning Talks have demonstrated the capabilities and the workshop is planned during Ship Summit. 
- Worked with Marketing to incept and mature the idea around showcasing our VSM workshop on the Torque engagement for internal credibility with Risers (demonstrating that we've changed company process based on their feedback) as well as an external offering for potential clients.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Kristin Pearson:**
Excited to have your role stood up and have you on board. What I would love to see as we have new director roles is a sense of curiosity for what's been tried already, exactly what problems need to be solved and when, and how to best leverage the brains around them. Especially for people with history related to Rise8, it may be easy to make assumptions about what to do and why, and I'd encourage identifying and checking those assumptions as we all charge hard ahead.

**Adam Furtado:**
Max is great in this role. He's incredibly professional, always kind, and puts people first. Those things, which make him stand out, are also the basis for what he could improve. Max' first instinct is to take blame on himself and ensure he is supporting his people, sometimes in situations where feedback in the moment in necessary if someone is under performing. Negative feedback to practitioners and peers usually comes after strategy and debate - I think Max needs to work on building confidence in his expertise and abilities and trust hus judgment in the moment to counter balance his normal approach.

**Joseph Andrews:**
Max stepped into a massively complex remit and moved with the conviction a scaling company needs. The first 60–90 days have been messy, but that was predictable given the scope of change. I believe his vision for delivery is the right one and aligns with where Rise8 needs to go. I’d rehire him: he’s making the tough calls that will pay off, and with sharper retention focus on A-Players I’m confident the transition will land successfully.

**Jeff Wills:**
While the time has been short, I have gotten to see Max's impact on Rise8 and Delivery specifically. I rated many of these best in class. A leader sets the example for those who follow, and Max does just that.  (I haven't interacted as much with Ainslie and therefore didn't rate her as high, but I suspect by next cycle she'll be near the top in all marks based on first impressions.  A big long caveat to say I didn't rate you high because you're the boss.)




I have really appreciated how you have pushed for organizational changes that will help us succeed and scale. As I have said, I've already begun to learn from you. There's nothing better than having someone above you that you can learn from.  I knew that I wasn't director material yet, but perhaps after working with you for a while, I'll get there.  Not sure if I want to take that step even if I'm prepared.




You lay out expectations when clarity is needed.  You seem to use this strategically and only when it's helpful. This makes things easier in the remote environment. With all the async comms its easy to lose what's a priority.




You're really good at giving feedback up the chain and to peers. I think the most significant area you have to grow with feedback is providing direct, honest feedback down the chain.  Not sure how the chain translates to a flat org.

**Jeff Muller:**
I've enjoyed working with Max these past few months and really appreciate his laser focus on delivery execution.

**Becca James:**
Max's addition to Rise8 has demonstrated early impact on refocusing towards delivery performance. He has shown that he thinks carefully (and quickly) taking into consideration the voices of others. He demonstrates qualities of leadership to include transparency, candor, and attentive focus. I am looking forward to seeing what he is able to accomplish within his first year, but believe that he is setting the groundwork to allow for Rise8 to effectively scale.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
Max has made an incredible impact in just a few months, establishing a strong strategic vision and a stabilizing presence that the team truly enjoys. However, large organizational transitions are inherently messy, and I have observed some lingering confusion regarding the division of responsibilities between Delivery Leads and Enablement Leads. While the strategic direction is clear, clarifying the operational mechanics of performance management and role transitions will help the team navigate this shift with more confidence and hopefully reduce any lingering anxiety.

**Kevan Mordan:**
Max jumped in headfirst and has dramatically altered delivery at Rise8 within these short few months. Some decisions were great, some might backfire, but altogether I can't think of a better first shot that could have been taken. I appreciate you trying to make this feel like a delivery-first and also engineering led company. In the past, there have been times where we talked about delivery and talked about engineering excellence, but there was a mismatch between what was said and the actual org structure and messaging (for example saying we are going all in on delivery but not having delivery or practices represented in quarterly leadership priority read outs).

**Ainsilie Hibbard:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Max because he leads by example, consistently bringing fresh ideas and high standards to the team. He fiercely protects and advocates for his people, creating a work environment where we feel supported, motivated, and proud to do our best. His leadership not only drives results but also inspires loyalty and confidence - qualities that make him an invaluable asset to our team.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
You have come in and completely upended all of the existing structure and somehow . . . over a relatively short period of time, it feel like we've settled into a solid new pattern.  I think this speaks to the overall clarity of vision.  I don't know how much feedback about this process will be relevant to the future.  In general, I think it would think it would be helpful to collaborate as a group around the future state.  You've mentioned this a few times, and I look forward to it.  There have been a couple attempts (like the post mortem) to identify process that need more clarity, but I think the overall scope was too big or amorphous to make that conversation useful.  At this point, the details are shaking out anyway.  But as we get into phase two (outcome management and metrics tracking) we'll probably need to get consistent about expectations across portfolios.  As we drop the big group meetings and move to portfolio syncs, our opportunities to hear what other DLs are doing will fall away, so we'll need to either have some group time to level set or lean on you to communicate news as needed .




Overall, I don't think it was an easy transition, but you got it done quickly by providing just enough guidance and letting it roll.  I think we were better off just ripping the bandaid off instead of planning everything to death.  It left a lot of things to figure out, but we had the autonomy to do it.  I think your balance of high level  vision with support where needed was effective.  Maybe not comfortable all the time, but it worked :)

**Carlo Viray:**
Max, because I’ve known you since our USAF days, I already had full confidence in your work ethic, your dedication to the mission, and your commitment to excellence. Having you join Rise8 has honestly been something I’ve looked forward to for a long time, and I’m really excited for everything you’re going to bring as we scale. I know you care deeply about delivery quality, accountability, and doing things the right way, and that shows in how quickly you came in and started making thoughtful changes.




The only reason I marked “haven’t had an opportunity to observe” for outcomes in production is because you inherited our current accounts, and we haven’t kicked off a brand-new engagement under your leadership yet (maybe ACE). I’m excited to see your discipline and rigor when that opportunity comes, but it’s hard to say right now whether outcomes from our existing accounts are because of the new direction you’re driving or because those teams were already trending that way.




And on the unnecessary rules piece — the only reason I didn’t rate that higher is because you mentioned wanting to take time to understand everything before making changes, but in reality the shifts in Delivery happened pretty quickly. I totally get why and I agree that things often get harder before they get better. I just want to be mindful of how the new processes and expectations, especially around Growth’s working model with Delivery and Enablement, the push for earlier VSMs, and the new Growth Support ticket system, impact customer experience and our ability to qualify and close new business. I’m all for experimenting, I just want to make sure we’re not unintentionally creating friction that slows things down.




Overall, I’m really glad you’re here and I’m excited to keep building together.

**Jordan Dilworth:**
Your experience and background create high expectations that you're now focused on implementing across Rise8.  In a short period of time, you've established a leading voice on the leadership team and are not afraid to deliver hard truths.

**Bryon Kroger:**
On "challenges directly and provides quality feedback without making others feel like they aren’t cared for" I think you are going to have to ride a delicate line of saying what needs to be said while making others feel cared for. Make sure you're giving a good ratio of positive to negative.
On "No Unnecessary Rules" I very much view you as a rules/structure kind of person. This is a big growth area. I will continue to engage as I see it come up, but in general the most helpful thing I can recommend is to always reframe with "am I attacking the problem or a symptom" and for problems "how else might we solve this problem".

**Kristin Pearson:**
I appreciate your efforts to improve comms to delivery ICs and think that's been needed.  
I would be cautious asking too much of ICs outside their account work, whether DLs or others.  The pendulum had swung fairly far in that direction previously, where "additional duty" contributions were tracked and there was a (misleading) idea those activities were necessary to be an A Player, and we ended up seeing compromised account focus/outcomes as a result.

**Adam Furtado:**
Be more clear about what you are asking out of people and then hold them accountable to providing it.  I think you've been a bit too... lenient in how the Delivery Leads have transitioned into their roles. I think there was an opportunity to say "I get change is hard, but this is what I want- and you are in these positions to do x, y, z.  What do you need to be successful?"   




Keep: You are 100% driven to delivering mission outcomes. The way you talk about it is exactly what BK needs in terms of you carrying a message and strategy.  Keep that up even if people get annoyed by it.




Stop: You are a strategic leader. You will never be a leader again that has relationships with everyone in your organization. Stop feeling bad about that. Your job is KPIs and optimizing the machine. Sucks to hear- but it's the reality. The best thing you can do is communicate intent, execute on it, measure impact, and do it again.  People will respect that and follow you.

**Joseph Andrews:**
**Start**
- Do a focused “listening tour” for A-Players and key contributors (skip-levels or small group sessions) to surface concerns and retention risks early.
- Prioritize a handful of near-term wins (process fixes, role clarity, quick tooling improvements) that signal momentum and reduce anxiety.
- Formalize a short-term retention checklist for high-value Risers (clear career paths, recognition, targeted 1:1s, compensation conversations where needed).
**Stop**
- Avoid overloading the team with simultaneous big changes (org, benefits, new leaders) without extra guardrails and communications — it amplifies stress.
**Keep**
- Keep the ambitious vision, it’s strategic and the right direction for scaling.
- Keep being decisive and willing to make hard structural calls; that clarity is necessary even if the transition is messy.

**Jeff Wills:**
Keep pushing for changes that will help us scale.
Start giving direct but kind feedback downward.

**Jeff Muller:**
I'm looking forward to see the impact Max will have in 2026 with a full-year to focus on delivery execution.  Once challenge we'll need to manage is creating the processes to ensure execution that Risers perceive as adding value to their day-to-day work and avoid creating unnecessary rules.

**Becca James:**
Start: Not for an immediate, but it would be really helpful to see what hypotheses you have for implemented changes in delivery, and to know what kind of success you are looking for. I think this framing would resonate with delivery and provide insight into the why behind your strategy.
Continue: Emphasize clear communication with Risers and consider adding additional mediums for that communication. When asking Risers to internalize a change (policies, process, renaming/reog) of any kind, repetition is necessary, not just to many different groups of people, but to the largest common denominator group. I personally think your communication has been clear, but recognize that others might not be as plugged in.
Stop: In group settings, I have noticed that statements that you make can come across as unyielding absolutes, particularly when in response to something said that may deviate from your point of view. While respectful of your authority as Delivery Director, over time team members might feel less willing to express ideas, opinions, and perspectives if they don't feel like they are worth expressing (i.e. you likely already have a absolute opinion). There is definitely time and occasion for decisive decision-making, but I would caution over-rotating on that, especially during a period of transition (both for yourself and the team).

**Joshua Pritchett:**
- **Keep** bringing your strong presence and strategic clarity. You are "crushing it" when it comes to setting the North Star. Your leadership style is highly motivating, and your ability to hit the ground running has provided a much-needed anchor for the team during this transition.
- **Consider** that ambiguity around performance management could be creating anxiety. While your strategy is clear, the specific expectations regarding the transition are still unclear for a few folks. Since this is a sensitive area for people's careers, ambiguity here can inadvertently cause nerves especially as individuals realize they may need to build new relationships or rethink current ones with their leads.
- **Start** gathering feedback from the tactical level to pinpoint exactly where the confusion lies. Currently, individual contributors are unsure how responsibilities will shift from Enablement Leads to Delivery Leads over the next few months. Investigating this specific gap will help settle the team's nerves, and you may uncover other areas of uncertainty to address as you learn more.

**Kevan Mordan:**
Start - Providing greater awareness of upcoming changes. I understand the desire to not cause waves when new policy/direction/guidance is in infancy, but sometimes a simple "hey, currently reviewing x, it's in very early stages but will provide updates as becomes more concrete"




Start - Always be direct and explicit. Sometimes I feel you are hinting at something or not saying something while trying to protect me. I want you to be as demanding of me as possible, or open a communication thread if you are ever in doubt or want input. Additionally, sometimes it is hard to tell if you are seeking input or not and I don't want to constantly provide a stream of input if you are not looking for it at the time.




Keep - Advocating for the right delivery structure and empowering all Risers.

**Ainsilie Hibbard:**
Please continue driving excellence across the delivery organization. Your focus on high standards (specifically being an A Player), clarity, and follow through sets the tone for the entire team and pushes us to perform at our best. Please stop letting occasional minor operational fires derail strategic focus, and delegate those when possible. Please keep giving more visibility into your decision making process, which helps us (especially me) learn and better mirror your judgement.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Start: Facilitating more DL team conversations (or asking us to do it); opening up draft versions of the vision so we can contribute; reiterating message to the delivery org where needed (they don't always pick things up the first time).  




Continue: Handling difficult conversations with consideration; balancing guidance with autonomy; engaging with and offering support for project level challenges; creating an environment that respects everyone as humans.  Really appreciate that last one.  You're careful to tell people to balance times we need to surge with time to recuperate, and it seems clear you want to handle the tough conversations with Risers in a careful and respectful way.  That kind of respect for everyone inside and outside of work go a long way to making the org a place where people want to stay for the long term, and we need all our A players.

**Carlo Viray:**
**Start:**
Once you finalize the roles and responsibilities with the legacy PLs and the new Delivery, Enablement, and Customer Success setup, it would help me and my team a ton if you could share that clearly. We need to understand our operating boundaries and who owns what so we can engage the right people and not unintentionally create confusion. I also need more clarity around how to handle the Growth Support ticket process. I worry that Growth might come across as overly demanding because everything feels like an ASAP, but the reality is that time kills all deals. I’d rather get a clear “we can’t help you” than a vague “we can in X weeks.” If it’s a capacity bottleneck, just say it and we’ll figure out how to keep moving.




**Stop:**
I don’t think I have anything concrete here. There’s a lot of change happening and I’m patient with all of it. I’m totally open to experimentation and trying new models. I’m still learning how the new structure is affecting IC morale and account health, so I don’t have anything to point to yet. I just really hope we can find ways to retain our top Risers and avoid losing people like Graham and Stefan, because losing folks like that hurts.




**Keep:**
Keep holding ICs and delivery teams accountable for getting to outcomes and representing Rise8’s brand well with customers. Keep giving me feedback if Growth is being too demanding or if Delivery just doesn’t have the capacity to support. And keep being open to feedback from me without taking it personally. I appreciate how direct and grounded our conversations have been so far, and I hope we can keep that up.

**Jordan Dilworth:**
Keep pushing to make the changes that needed to happen and holding your team and all delivery team members to a higher standard!  That flywheel effect is real and we have to deliver for our customers to be successful in the future. You've made incredible progress in a short period of time - keep rocking it until we're the best delivery org in the business and customers are screaming to work with Rise8.

**Bryon Kroger:**
Start: increasing the ratios of positive interactions, and building more social capital. 
Keep: asking the hard questions and challenging the defaults. this is good tension.
