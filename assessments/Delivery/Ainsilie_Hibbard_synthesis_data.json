  "enps_comments": "**Christal Walker:**\nEven in this short time, your contributions have brought noticeable relief to the team. You've quickly immersed yourself in the work, demonstrating a commendable eagerness to learn and rapidly develop your skills. Your transparency about seeking guidance when needed is highly valued. Please keep up this excellent momentum; it's making a real difference.\n\n**Jeff Wills:**\nI marked many of these Solid Performers as I have been impressed thus far, but my time working with Ainsillie has been limited.  I suspect by next review most if not all of these will be best in class based off of first impressions.\n\n\n\n\nAinsillie acts quickly to release the first iteration of a document or process and then quickly adapts and improves it based on feedback.  She is proactive in identifying needs and meeting them with minimal input, regularly suggesting solutions to delivery problems.\n\n\n\n\nAinsillie is open to feedback on how to use the Rise8 tooling better.  She is motivated to find the best and fastest way to solve problems.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Christal Walker:**\nAinsilie, your personality is truly infectious, and I deeply appreciate how approachable you are. My only regret is that we didn't have the chance to collaborate sooner! Your fresh perspective and insightful questions have already made a significant positive impact. Please keep 'poking holes' and challenging the status quo\u2014your ideas are invaluable. Given how little time we've worked together, I can't recommend any changes, but perhaps that just speaks to the excellent job you're currently doing!\n\n**Jeff Wills:**\nStop: You have good judgment, go for it.  You don't need to ask before making a comment in my doc.  Yes, please do it, it will be a better doc because you commented.  There have been other instances where you asked before doing, and I didn't think it necessary.  Move Fast break things, #bias-for-action, better to ask for forgiveness and all that stuff.\n\n\n\n\nKeep being proactive and finding ways to jump in and help!\n",
