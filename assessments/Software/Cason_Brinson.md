### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I am confident I would be enthusiastically rehired on my team for several key reasons: my capacity for rapid learning, my adaptability in moving to an entirely new app team, my core software engineering skills, and my positive contribution to our team's culture. First, joining this team meant learning multiple large codebases, adopting new standards, and understanding the contract and purpose of our project as a whole. These challenges required me to learn quickly in order to contribute effectively. Secondly, my experience jumping from project to project to deliver outcomes has been demonstrated many times here at Rise8. Having worked on numerous projects, I have gained significant experience diving into existing codebases, starting new initiatives, learning new frameworks, and contributing quickly. Thirdly, my skills as a software engineer have been evident this past year. I have a strong attention to detail that helps me think through complex scenarios fully and implement software that is both efficient and functional. Lastly, our team has an excellent culture and a safe, collaborative environment. We are able to work fast and deliver outcomes, and our team's cohesiveness and morale have stayed high. I am proud to be an active contributor to this positive dynamic, and I value how well we all work together.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: 
Next year, I plan to focus more on soft skills, such as presenting, and on being more visible in discussions within my team and the company as a whole. While I currently provide my feedback and opinions, I will be more vocal and push harder for my thoughts. I also plan to contribute more frequently to our team's "Outcomes in Prod" presentations during prod hall, getting more involved in the writing and planning process.




Keep: 
I plan to keep learning and developing my skillset as a software engineer. I will stay current on programming languages and frameworks to be most effective on new projects, especially those with unfamiliar technologies. I also plan to keep outputting high-quality work at a quick pace. I believe my attention to detail helps me solve complex problems and account for potential errors, and I plan to hone this skill further. Lastly, I will keep contributing to our "Outcomes in Prod" presentations by staying up-to-date and assisting with writing.




Stop:
I plan to stop waiting for the perfect moment to join in team discussions. In the past, I have sometimes polished my thoughts internally rather than sharing them immediately. This coming year, I will focus on offering my perspective more readily as this directly supports my Start goal of being more visible and contributing more actively to team solutions.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. I joined a new application team when they were down a member, and I integrated quickly by learning their codebase and team practices. I was able to start contributing effectively right away, which allowed the team to maintain its velocity and keep the quality of work consistent. The impact for Rise8 was ensuring a key project stayed on schedule and preventing a gap in team capability.
2. I contributed to multiple "Outcomes in Prod" for the Blitzar app, which included visiting users on-site. I interviewed users face-to-face to identify their specific pain points and then used that direct feedback to help build features that solved their problems. I built a good rapport with both users and stakeholders in the process. The impact for Rise8 was delivering mission value directly to the user and strengthening our partnership with key stakeholders which makes Rise8 as a whole look great.
3. I successfully onboarded to a new and unfamiliar codebase within my contract, the Kahless UI. This involved learning a new framework (Angular) and understanding its microservice architecture. I was able to get up to speed quickly and begin contributing new features in a short amount of time. The impact for Rise8 was that I was able to quickly add new features to this project, directly supporting our mission of delivering outcomes in prod and makes our brand look trustworthy and efficient to get a job done that we say we will, regardless of the level of difficulty.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Cason is a highly flexible and adaptable developer dedicated to delivering value across unfamiliar systems. He successfully navigated a major context switch, moving from Blitzar now to the EM&C Kahless microservice architecture. As a self-starter who quickly detects technical patterns, he immediately dove into a service written in the Go language, determined the key implementation areas for our task, and successfully transferred those essential learnings and context to the rest of the team. This ability to immediately share knowledge significantly speeds up our team's adoption of new technology.




Cason has an easy-going personality and actively participates in team activities, building a strong foundation of trust and camaraderie.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep participating in team activities; your easy-going personality is valuable for building morale and strong internal relationships.




We recognize your existing understanding of cloud services, architecture, and Kubernetes. I recommend you use the upcoming project to deepen that foundation. I foresee us having lots of opportunities to interact with a much more complex K8s cluster and all its resources.




I'd like to see Cason provide more feedback on technical strategies, solutions, or any improvement ideas.

**Comment**:
> Proactively driving discussions by sharing your own ideas and proposing solutions, rather than only implementing what’s already been decided. Taking initiative on small improvements or refactors that move the product forward without needing direction.




Avoiding a passive role in team settings. Being calm and composed is a strength, but voicing your perspective more often will increase your visibility and impact.




Communicating clearly and calmly. Your ability to walk others through your thought process builds trust and keeps the team grounded. You iterate thoughtfully on code, aim for best practices, support teammates when they're stuck, and offer constructive feedback on PRs. You also plan your work in a structured, intentional way.

He's shown great growth in taking full ownership of outcomes, demonstrated by his work on the Enterprise Health Monitor. He quickly tackles complex logic and structure with minimal prompting, which proves he's able to operate independently and articulate solutions.




He's a great team player who has also improved his participation in team meetings, which shows his commitment to improving team communication and process.

Start making his technical contributions visible to the wider Rise8 community. Given his long tenure, Cason has valuable expertise to share. He should start looking for opportunities to attend or lead company-wide knowledge sharing events or technical forums to share his insights and increase his overall presence within the organization.
