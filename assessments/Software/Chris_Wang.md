**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would rehire me because I provide technical stability, high-trust collaboration, and a bias for action that results in shipped software. In a high-agency environment, I balance "doing what works" with "doing it right." My teammates know that I don't seek to win arguments for the sake of being right; instead, I strive to counteract confirmation bias and reason through to sound engineering and product decisions.




Additionally, I play a stabilizing role on the team. I communicate with intention, focusing heavily on listening, synthesizing context, and executing. This approach has allowed me to build immense trust within the team and with our external partners, smoothing friction and helping to de-risk our outcomes in production. I am low-ego, high-output, and consistently focused on the mission.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Looking for opportunities to share my technical knowledge more broadly. As someone who is naturally introverted, my default is to focus on execution. However, I see the value in sharing knowledge. I aim to sign up for a Lightning Talk (perhaps jointly with a teammate or two), using that as a way to participate more visibly in our company culture.




Stop: Assuming that my competence is always automatically visible. While I prefer to let my work speak for itself, I recognize that in a fast-moving environment, it would help me to be more vocal about strategic wins (like the Certificate Health Monitor opportunity).




Keep: Focusing on psychological safety and holding space for my teammates. I try to remain observant of team dynamics, noticing if someone wanted to contribute but didn't get the chance, and speaking up for them, or reaching out directly to ensure they feel supported and valued personally.




Keep: Fostering the high-trust relationship with our external partner teams. My humble and professional approach has earned some capital with them, and I will continue to use that capital to help our team's account strategy.




Keep: Trusting my intuition. I will continue to voice concerns when my experience suggests a risk, even if I do not yet have a fully constructed argument. I recognize that our team dynamic can be skeptical of "incomplete" thoughts, but I feel it's more important to catch leading indicators of failure early.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Getting the "Certificate Health Monitor" project into the Halkan release (Be Bold / Do What Works / Outcomes in Prod). I identified a strategic opportunity during a routine check-in with stakeholder Aaron Gonzales. I took the initiative to demo our work after only a few weeks, showing a prototype that already featured 80% of his desired functionality. This timely move, executed well ahead of schedule, got us into the "Halkan" release (EM&C PI 7), even though the initial cutoff had already passed. This result not only put outcomes in production a full cycle early, but Aaron’s positive reception placed us on his "gold star" list and secured our next project assignments.




2. Pragmatic engineering decisions (Do The Right Thing). During the development of our Narrowband Resource Request parsing logic, I successfully advocated for and implemented a database view strategy to handle the two distinct request types. Despite strong internal pressure to use a single-table approach, I leveraged my experience to demonstrate why views were the elegant and correct engineering choice. This decision prevented significant technical debt and ensured our data models remain maintainable as we continue development of the product.




3. Building trust with external codebase owners (Always Be Kind). I have cultivated a critical relationship with the external engineering teams whose codebases we contribute to. By approaching them with professionalism and respect, rather than grandstanding, I have built a level of trust that allows our team to operate with several degrees of freedom. This "quiet diplomacy" has been essential in getting our code merged and ensuring our "Outcomes in Prod" continue to happen on (or ahead of) schedule.

**Comment**:
> Chris has been a great teammate - kind, collaborative, and easy to work with. I  appreciate the support he provided in product acceptance testing and helping product strengthen testing clarity and rigor. He brings thoughtful ideas on how product and engineering can work more closely together, which has made a noticeable difference in team alignment.




Chris also brings a strong technical voice to Narrowband. His insights on feasibility, system behavior, and SAR-grounded implementation considerations have helped ensure we’re building the right things in the right way. His feedback during the workflow editor demo was especially valuable - encouraging product to showcase the entire flow rather than just granular features helped elevate the quality and clarity of our presentation.




One thing I really admire about Chris is his deliberate, thoughtful approach to project implementation. He analyzes multiple risks when making decisions, provides sound reasoning, and ensures the team has a stable technical path forward. He is a strong engineer and a natural leader whose experience helps steer the team toward high-quality solutions. He also consistently looks out for team success making sure our backlog is prepped, groomed, and filled enough for development to stay unblocked.




I’d encourage Chris to lean even more into those leadership qualities. Whether that’s giving a Lightning Talk, sharing technical insights with other engineers, or mentoring across the org, he has a lot of knowledge and positive influence to offer. He is valuable voice for the broader Rise8 engineering community. Overall, Chris is a reliable, thoughtful, and high-impact teammate who makes working together and productive.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Chris. He is always thinking ahead and pushing for clarity, which helps the team navigate challenges smoothly. For example, during Pre-IPM, he questions features that might not be valuable yet, which helps us prioritize the work that actually matters. He also spots underlying system problems and ensures they get ticketed, which prevents bugs in the product later on.




His experience is a huge asset for the team. When I pair with him, he doesn't just code—he actively mentors me, pointing out potential pitfalls and offering advice that has helped me improve my own skills. His focus on clear design prevents rework and saves us from having to constantly ask for clarification, which makes us all more productive.

**Comment**:
> **Start:** I would love to see you start taking on the SWE anchor role when it's time to rotate. Your foresight and ability to spot system-level issues would be a huge asset in that position, and I think you would be great at it.




**Stop:** If anything, I suggest you stop hesitating when you are confident in a decision. Your instincts are solid, and the team trusts your judgment, so don't be afraid to be bold and make the call.




**Keep:** Please keep challenging our features in Pre-IPM and pushing for that high standard of design clarity. Your willingness to mentor and share your experience during pairing is invaluable.

**Comment**:
> Chris is a **high-value addition to the team** who excels at problem solving, and communication.




He has a strong ability to synthesize complex information, specifically regarding long-term impacts and potential risks, and has saved the team lots of time with his insights. His ability to scaffold patterns that support future complexity is a major asset to our codebase.




In pairing sessions, he is communicative and transparent, explaining his thought process clearly and raising valid concerns in real-time. While his caution is excellent for quality control, and team relationships internally and within EM&C portfolio, it occasionally hinders momentum when risk identification isn't immediately paired with a constructive path forward. He is a strong advocate for team health and consistently supports collective decisions once made. Lastly, he has been a great source of feedback, and has approached conflict in a very healthy way, leading to a lot of trust being built across the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing:**
- Keep synthesizing the "big picture" constraints. Your foresight regarding long-term engineering impacts and identifying detrimental UX issues before we ship is a superpower.
- Keep scaffolding patterns in our codebase (even if it's just mirroring Wideband sometimes). Implementing patterns early on that help the codebase handle growing complexity has saved the team significant technical debt compared to more independant workflows/implementations.
- Keep providing real and raw feedback, even when it's uncomfortable.
**Stop Doing:**
- Stop identifying risks without proposing mitigations. Highlighting a problem without a potential solution slows momentum and can feel like blocking rather than helping.
- Stop letting "caution" serve as a brake on alignment. Ensure that your desire to prevent issues doesn't come across as resistance to the team's outcomes; we need to move forward even when the path isn't 100% risk-free.
**Start Doing:**
- Start practicing "solution-first" feedback. When you spot a risk, frame it immediately with a path forward (e.g., "This creates Risk X, so I propose we do Y to mitigate it and keep moving").
- Start calibrating your risk assessment for speed. Help the team distinguish between "critical blockers" and "acceptable trade-offs" so we can maintain velocity while staying safe.

**Comment**:
> Chris combines a strong technical discipline with a high sense of ownership, multiplying his contributions to the team.




- **Ownership & Value Focus:** They have demonstrated a ship outcomes mindset rather than a ship outputs mindset. I appreciate that they see stories all the way through to E2E and Dev environments to verify functionality, often going the extra mile to fix peripheral issues caused by other teams. Their participation in rituals is also crucial; they don't just accept requirements, they help shape them to ensure we are delivering measurable user value.
- **XP Discipline:** In an age where AI can sometimes encourage isolation, Chris has maintained the discipline of true pair programming. They use pairing not just to write code, but to share knowledge and prevent silos.
- **Technical Quality:** Their code is consistently well-tested, reliable, and maintainable, setting a standard for the rest of the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Keep:** Please keep your focus on mentorship during pairing. You have a natural ability to teach and share context while coding, which prevents knowledge silos and upskills the team. This is exactly the kind of "force multiplier" behavior we need from a Senior Engineer.
- **Start:** I would like to see you start exercising your authority as a Senior Engineer to guide team dynamics more actively. If a meeting is going off the rails, or if one voice is dominating the room, I encourage you to step in and facilitate. You have the respect of the team; use that capital to keep our rituals focused and our discussions productive. You have the "right of way" to push back when things aren't right, please use it.
- **Stop:** I recommend you stop feeling the need to concede just to resolve friction quickly. While being agreeable is a good trait, sometimes "keeping the peace" comes at the cost of the best technical or process decision. Don't shy away from holding your ground or managing friction directly; the team looks to you for that stability and direction.
