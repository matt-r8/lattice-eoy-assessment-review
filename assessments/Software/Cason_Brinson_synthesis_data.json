  "employee_name": "Cason Brinson",
  "accomplishments": "1. I joined a new application team when they were down a member, and I integrated quickly by learning their codebase and team practices. I was able to start contributing effectively right away, which allowed the team to maintain its velocity and keep the quality of work consistent. The impact for Rise8 was ensuring a key project stayed on schedule and preventing a gap in team capability.\n2. I contributed to multiple \"Outcomes in Prod\" for the Blitzar app, which included visiting users on-site. I interviewed users face-to-face to identify their specific pain points and then used that direct feedback to help build features that solved their problems. I built a good rapport with both users and stakeholders in the process. The impact for Rise8 was delivering mission value directly to the user and strengthening our partnership with key stakeholders which makes Rise8 as a whole look great.\n3. I successfully onboarded to a new and unfamiliar codebase within my contract, the Kahless UI. This involved learning a new framework (Angular) and understanding its microservice architecture. I was able to get up to speed quickly and begin contributing new features in a short amount of time. The impact for Rise8 was that I was able to quickly add new features to this project, directly supporting our mission of delivering outcomes in prod and makes our brand look trustworthy and efficient to get a job done that we say we will, regardless of the level of difficulty.",
  "enps_comments": "**Peter Duong:**\nCason is a highly flexible and adaptable developer dedicated to delivering value across unfamiliar systems. He successfully navigated a major context switch, moving from Blitzar now to the EM&C Kahless microservice architecture. As a self-starter who quickly detects technical patterns, he immediately dove into a service written in the Go language, determined the key implementation areas for our task, and successfully transferred those essential learnings and context to the rest of the team. This ability to immediately share knowledge significantly speeds up our team's adoption of new technology.\n\n\n\n\nCason has an easy-going personality and actively participates in team activities, building a strong foundation of trust and camaraderie.\n\n**Nick Eissler:**\nI agree that I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.  Cason is a talented and reliable engineer who consistently delivers solid work with a great attitude.  He's very open to collaboration and feedback, is great to pair with, and brings good instincts to engineering discussions and code reviews.  His engineering work has been a big part of our success, such as playing a key role in the UI work for our complex reporting feature in Blitzar and quickly ramping up on the new Angular codebase, to which he has been meaningfully contributing to.  On top of his technical contributions Cason is a great teammate and is always willing to take on work the team needs.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nCason has consistently delivered solid work and is a dependable team member.

  "start_stop_keep": "**Peter Duong:**\nKeep participating in team activities; your easy-going personality is valuable for building morale and strong internal relationships.\n\n\n\n\nWe recognize your existing understanding of cloud services, architecture, and Kubernetes. I recommend you use the upcoming project to deepen that foundation. I foresee us having lots of opportunities to interact with a much more complex K8s cluster and all its resources.\n\n\n\n\nI'd like to see Cason provide more feedback on technical strategies, solutions, or any improvement ideas.\n\n**Nick Eissler:**\n**Keep:**\nKeep up your solid engineering work and the way you collaborate with others.  Your positive attitude is a big contributor to out team health.\n\n\n\n\n**Start:**\nStart being more proactive in taking on ambiguous problems and identifying blockers before they become issues. Building a stronger sense of how upcoming product needs influence our plans will help us anticipate challenges earlier. Leaning into that mindset will strengthen your leadership and overall impact.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nProactively driving discussions by sharing your own ideas and proposing solutions, rather than only implementing what\u2019s already been decided. Taking initiative on small improvements or refactors that move the product forward without needing direction.\n\n\n\n\nAvoiding a passive role in team settings. Being calm and composed is a strength, but voicing your perspective more often will increase your visibility and impact.\n\n\n\n\nCommunicating clearly and calmly. Your ability to walk others through your thought process builds trust and keeps the team grounded. You iterate thoughtfully on code, aim for best practices, support teammates when they're stuck, and offer constructive feedback on PRs. You also plan your work in a structured, intentional way.\n\n**Ian Sperry:**\nKeep owning those critical outcomes and maintaining that high standard of consistency. His reliable execution is a foundational asset for the entire team, and he should continue to quickly step up and take charge of complex feature work.\n\n\n\n\nStart making his technical contributions visible to the wider Rise8 community. Given his long tenure, Cason has valuable expertise to share. He should start looking for opportunities to attend or lead company-wide knowledge sharing events or technical forums to share his insights and increase his overall presence within the organization.\n\n**Darla McGraw:**\nCason should continue to exemplify and hold the team accountable for representing Rise8 values while leaning into contributing to strategy. He should continue to cross pair with all disciplines to plan as well as give feedback when ideating or solutionizing.\n",
