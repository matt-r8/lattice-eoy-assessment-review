  "accomplishments": "1. Refactoring Blitzar's Main Schema\n\n\n\n\nI led the effort to refactor Blitzar's resource request schema, a core schema in our application with many dependent types and DTOs, to support an alternate version of our form.  This included determining the solution, in this case using a discriminated union in our Zod schemas on the frontend and single table inheritance in our MySQL database, in order to maintain a singular schema (adding new schemas was something we wanted to avoid) while being able to support multiple form versions.  I justified this approach and the timeline with stakeholders as well, and we were able to complete the necessary overhauls and implement the new form version in around a week, delivering a key feature in production that provided value to the users.\n\n\n\n\n2. EM&C/Kahless Work\n\n\n\n\nThe team and I were able to transition to the Kahless system after rolling off Blitzar very quickly and added immediate value to the application.  This included exploring existing micro-services implemented as well as ramping up to their UI repo written in Angular, a framework I have not used before.  I was able to pick up on Angular and the patterns established in the repo quickly, implementing UI fixes and updates that have since been merged, providing value to the system in a short time.  I also helped lead a proof of concept (still WIP) for a micro-service within the Kahless system dedicated to allowing other services to use the SMTP relay set up in Botany Bay (and eventually the one in KM).  The SMPT service is what we identified as the most potential for outcomes during our stop-gap work, and the goal is to expand its usage out to other services within Kahless when the proof of concept is complete, adding a lot of value to the system.\n\n\n\n\n3. Reporting Feature\n\n\n\n\nI took a main role in developing the backend logic for our reporting feature, something we were able to deliver under a tight deadline prior to rolling off from Blitzar.  This feature took in a collection of filters from the frontend, and returned an excel file of resource requests matching the requested filters, as well as additional derived fields calculated from the request (like how many days it was in each stage).  I coordinated with our product team as well as users/stakeholders to define the behavior of the feature, and we were able to deliver a working solution prior to stopping work.  This was an existing feature in JIST, the app we aimed to replace, but generating accurate and useful reports could take hours.  Our implementation shortened the time to seconds, and we included behavior to give the user confidence in the data they were receiving prior to generating the report.",
  "enps_comments": "**Ian Sperry:**\nI'd enthusiastically rehire Nick because he's a reliable, steady force who consistently crushes his core engineering work while stepping up in areas that directly impact our team's visibility and product direction. He brings fantastic flexibility and a customer-first mindset that goes well beyond his current level.\n\n\n\n\nNick handled the deep dive into unfamiliar tech like SMTP services head-on, showing the kind of growth and flexibility we need. This makes him an incredibly valuable and dependable asset in any project.\n\n\n\n\nHe absolutely knocked it out of the park with the company-wide Blitzar demo. The positive feedback we got, especially from Customer Success, shows his ability to be a compelling external voice for the team\u2014a huge win for raising our profile.\n\n\n\n\nHis willingness to routinely volunteer for user discovery calls is key. He brings a valuable perspective that translates customer pain and product vision back to the technical work, which is exactly what a high-performing engineer should do.\n\n**Peter Duong:**\nNick is an exceptionally resourceful and competent engineer whose impact goes beyond feature delivery. He consistently demonstrates a bias for full ownership and delivers high-quality, fully tested solutions. He has a unique expertise in systemic health, proactively extending our observability capabilities to track key business metrics\u2014specifically by building Grafana queries that helped the team quantify the time saved for users and established critical health monitoring for our machine-to-machine integrations. He tackles challenging tasks with little need for clarification, always leaving the codebase (and test coverage) better than he found it. Overall, Nick is a great teammate with a calm and professional demeanor, enabling effective collaboration across the team.\n\n**Cason Brinson:**\nNick demonstrates a strong sense of ownership and a commitment to quality. He is reliable in delivering well-tested code and takes accountability for his project's outcomes. He is also an active collaborator, consistently offering constructive feedback during pairing sessions, retros, and product-planning meetings. Nick adapts to new challenges effectively, showing an ability to learn new codebases quickly. His long-term experience on this contract provides valuable customer context that helps the team in making decisions.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nI would gladly rehire Nick. Throughout our pairing sessions, he demonstrated strong ownership, clarity of thought, and a clear outcome oriented mindset. During my onboarding, he took the time to explain context and walk through his reasoning instead of just giving quick answers, which helped me get up to speed faster and accelerated my ability to contribute. When requirements were unclear, he was one of the first to push for clarity and make sure the team was aligned on what needed to be done.\n\n\n\n\nNick operates at a high level, doesn\u2019t wait to be told what to do, and consistently contributes quality work at speed. He assumed responsibility for core areas of Blitzar and became a dependable source of truth for metrics, environments, and overall implementation details. His communication style is clear, concise, and easy to digest even when discussing complex technical topics. \n\n\n\n\nMost importantly, Nick consistently aligns with the A Player agreement. He challenges assumptions, supports his teammates, keeps the mission at the forefront, and delivers value without adding unnecessary complexity. I believe his presence raises the bar for the team.\n\n**Darla McGraw:**\nNick is a highly reliable and accountable A-Player who has performed consistently at an exceptional level this year consistently delivering and showing deep engagement with the entire product process.\n\n\n\n\nNick proactively participates in the strategy and planning around outcomes, demonstrating an understanding and ownership of getting outcomes in prod. His engagement was highlighted this year when he co-facilitated a key workshop with end-users, directly influencing the feature definition and showing a strong commitment to user-centric design.\n\n\n\n\nDespite the team operating a person short due to a backfill, Nick seamlessly stepped up. His increased ownership and ability to maintain focus ensured no critical gaps or delays occurred, proving his dependability as a core engineer. Furthermore, Nick is a great collaborator, always willing to jump in to help the team and providing honest, constructive feedback to improve our collective practices.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Ian Sperry:**\nKeep connecting with the customer. His consistent volunteering for user discovery calls is a major strength. He should continue to lead these interactions and use his strong communication skills to represent our team externally.\n\n\n\n\nStart formalizing his technical foresight. The mid-year review noted that he could improve on identifying and flagging technical debt. Nick should start dedicating a small amount of time each sprint to review code and actively flag potential future risks or process bottlenecks, and then raise these risks directly to the team or the product manager.\n\n\n\n\nStop undervaluing his external contributions. His demo success and comfort in user calls show he has executive presence. He should not for permission to take the lead on team presentations or internal communications and instead proactively schedule or offer to run them himself.\n\n**Peter Duong:**\nContinue your growth mindset and refine those technical skills.\n\n\n\n\nYou have an understanding of cloud services and architecture, as well as container orchestration. Let's start deepening that understanding, as this project's microservice-based architecture will provide the opportunities.\n\n**Cason Brinson:**\nKeep:\nKeep taking strong ownership of your work and pushing for high quality. Also keep sharing your opinions and thoughts on decisions and implementations, as it's been very helpful in guiding team decisions.\n\n\n\n\nStart:\nNick should start promoting his ideas and thoughts with confidence as they could provide the team with valuable things to consider. Nick should also start giving feedback to other engineers after pairing or after working with them. His feedback is useful to help others grow.\n\n\n\n\nStop: \nTheres nothing I think Nick needs to stop doing, just the things above that he should start and keep doing!\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nI would like to see Nick share more of his technical thinking across Rise8. He has strong patterns and solutions that would benefit other engineers, and communicating them more widely could increase his impact. This could be through short lightning talks, documenting his thought process, or walking through architecture decisions during team sessions.\n\n\n\n\nAt times, he takes on a lot of responsibility and moves fast, which is a strength. But there are moments where bringing others into the process earlier could grow the team\u2019s overall capability.\n\n\n\n\nNick should continue sharing context and explaining his reasoning the way he does. It helped me onboard quickly and makes complex topics easier to understand. His PR feedback consistently improves code quality across the team, and I\u2019d like him to keep that level of attention. He should also continue taking initiative when requirements are unclear and structuring his ideas clearly in scratch files.\n\n**Darla McGraw:**\nContinue actively participating in the strategic discussions around outcomes, helping to define key technical metrics (like latency targets and error rates) that connect technical decisions directly to successful product outcomes. Your high level of ownership and reliability in maintaining velocity is critical\u2014keep demonstrating this full-cycle accountability.\n",
