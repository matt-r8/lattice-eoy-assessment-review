  "enps_comments": "**Abel A A Hernandez:**\nDanny had a tall order when joining the OSIT team as its first anchor. He had to navigate through lots of past \u201cbaggage\u201d from fractured team and customer relationships. Despite this he rolled up his sleeves and was an immediate contributor and leader with Product Managers, Designers and Engineers. Not saying it was easy or simple. He listened, he advised but most importantly he took action to help us improve. He is the walking Rise8 value for \u201cbe bold\u201d.\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nDanny Benson is an ideal teammate is pretty much every aspect. He carries the Rise8 values very naturally and is clearly a driving force for making warfighter impact. He is consistently soliciting feedback and is very constructive when giving it out. Everything is a team effort which is exactly the type of mindset we need. He does what needs to be done to accomplish the mission. His role as an anchor on this contract has helped us define new norms and get into a steady rhythm with our development work. I would enthusiastically rehire Danny on any team.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nDanny has done a phenonimal job in aligning the team and moving them in a single direction. He has also been able to build a high level of confidence with the product owners.\n\n**Sagar Akre:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Danny because he immediately elevated the team across multiple dimensions. He stepped in and worked fluidly across disciplines, helping bring order, clarity, and stronger execution practices to the team. Danny provides direct but caring feedback, and he consistently shows up not just as an engineering lead but as a true leader for the entire group.\n\n\n\n\nI already see Danny operating at a level above senior. His influence, judgment, and ability to guide others align more closely with a staff-level engineer. Beyond his technical leadership, he brings kindness, empathy, fun, and a strong work ethic that make him an invaluable teammate. Danny makes the team better in every way, and his presence raises the bar for everyone around him.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\nDanny is an exceptional engineer who consistently embodies the Rise8 culture, driving continuous improvement and actively soliciting feedback to enhance his performance. His commitment to the team's mission was evidenced by his proactive effort to secure SIPR access on base. This action was a critical success factor that unblocked multiple priority work streams and significantly accelerated our progress on the platform.\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nDanny possesses a compelling combination of strong leadership qualities and a solid technical foundation, making him an exceptionally reliable and effective contributor. He is an excellent critical thinker who approaches complex problems with meticulous scrutiny, consistently delivering highly detailed and comprehensive plans that clearly map the path to achieving organizational goals and missions. Crucially, Danny demonstrates mature judgment by guiding his team when necessary while also exhibiting the intellectual humility to consult subject matter experts on unfamiliar topics, ensuring decisions are well-informed rather than made in isolation. This collaborative approach, combined with his willingness to actively solicit and incorporate feedback, solidifies his reputation as a judicious and impactful leader.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\nDanny has taken on the Anchor role with a strong sense of responsibility and effectiveness. He ensures clear communication with customers, actively seeks clarification from other engineers when needed, and consistently represents the team well. He provides thoughtful feedback, receives it with openness, and encourages the adoption of processes that improve team coordination and delivery. Danny is also a reliable point of contact for stakeholders and helps maintain steady information flow between technical and non-technical individuals.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nDanny is a great role model for the rest of us to aspire towards. He's unafraid of hard conversations and provides clear, direct feedback when necessary. He asks questions to be certain he understands the conversation and makes sure we're walking on the right path. He's a great fit in the anchor role and stays on top of communicating with our customers.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nI haven't really had the change to pair or work with Danny, but from the 1:1s and interactions I was present for at meetings, I can tell that he is the head programmer for a reason. He shows all the hallmarks of a great leader and employee at Rise8. He isn't afraid to ask hard questions to anyone on the team to better understand the team member, or to better understand something he might not entirely understand.\n\n**Cory:**\nI would rehire Danny at his position due to his competency and leadership. He consistently provides feedback and makes sure we are on the correct course.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Abel A A Hernandez:**\n**Stop/Avoid** using chats (Slack or Teams) for delivering complex or dense feedback. While your directness is valuable (and works well in meetings!), written format can accidentally strip away necessary context and tone. Instead, grab some time on the calendar or just call us. Your 1:1 voice or video call is far more effective and cuts through the assumptions and misunderstandings.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep** making yourself readily available to both give and receive feedback. It's often difficult to maintain this consistency, but you have been an exception. While your passion sometimes shows, you are always diligent in ensuring your feedback is ultimately framed kindly, fairly, and actionably. Continue to prioritize this open line of communication.\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nI would recommend Danny continue to do what hes been doing. I dont think there is anything in particular he is lacking as an engineering lead nor anything that has to stop.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nContinue leading and holding the team accountable so that we can continually deliver value.\n\n**Sagar Akre:**\n## **Start Doing**\n- Taking more ownership of artifact creation, such as technical diagrams and product-facing documentation, and leaning even further into presenting them!\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\n**Start increasing visibility and influence:** Begin attending and presenting during formal product demonstrations and external stakeholder briefings to proactively showcase project progress and highlight engineering achievements.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop rushing to solutions:** Prioritize active listening and intentional communication during technical discussions. Dedicate more time to fully process a peer's input or an issue before contributing a solution, ensuring all perspectives are heard.\n\n\n\n\n**Continue elevating client technical understanding:** Maintain the strong focus on partnering with clients to translate complex technical blockers and decisions into clear, business-relevant language, thereby fostering trust and alignment.\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nStart: Increasing Technical Decision Engagement\nAs our technical anchor, I recommend you significantly increase your direct involvement in engineering decision-making. Given your unique perspective from interfacing directly with customers, your technical input is vital for bridging the divide between customer needs and the technical implementation roadmap. Your participation will help guide the engineering team toward solutions that are not only architecturally sound but also optimally aligned with high-level strategic goals, maximizing the impact of our development efforts. You already do this, but getting even more involved is great for the engineering team.\n\n\n\n\nStop: Over-Reliance on Customer Validation for Internal Work\nTo accelerate our internal velocity, I advise that we collectively reduce our dependency on continuous customer validation for advancing necessary internal development efforts. While customer feedback is essential for external features, initiatives focused on technical debt, infrastructure, or performance improvements that guarantee substantial long-term operational wins should be prioritized and executed based on internal strategic merit, rather than waiting for external approval. Your influence can help champion this proactive investment strategy.\n\n\n\n\nKeep: Maintaining Candid Team Communication\nPlease continue providing your consistently honest and unfiltered input in all team discussions. This raw candor is a unique and valuable strength that acts as a vital catalyst for productive debate and transparent communication. By openly raising crucial, sometimes challenging, points, you ensure the team considers all angles, leading to better-informed strategic alignment and ultimately resulting in higher-quality collective decisions.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\n**Keep**: Communicating clearly, staying open to feedback, and guiding the team through process improvements.\n**Start**: Make a habit of verifying functionality more deliberately during release. For more complex changes, consider bringing in teammates to help confirm everything works as expected. This will help build shared ownership and reduce the chance of issues slipping through.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nI know this isn't useful feedback, but I cannot think of anything Danny should change. He's a fantastic representative of Rise8 and holds his peers to a high standard. He communicates kindly and is thoughtful and reflective when he might not be the most experience or knowledgable on a topic or situation.\n\n\n\n\nAfter writing that out, the only thing I can maybe offer as a \"start doing\" is leading by example with pro dev. He's done a great job becoming familiar with Warp Core after joining the team recently, but I don't have any examples of pro dev he's spoken about.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nUnfortunately I can't really say too much here as I have only had minimal interaction with you so I can't say for sure what you do well or poorly other than that I really like the biweekly 1:1s and they should be continued, it really helps with getting a better feeling on being a member of the team.\n\n**Cory:**\nOverall, I view Danny as a dependable senior who has great big-picture vision. He often provides feedback and brings up possible issues immediately, which I value. One small thing I have noticed is that, on occasion, said feedback can come off a little too passionate(and I mean only a little) and I feel that it adds some heaviness/tension that can temporarily slow down the following problem solving.\n",
