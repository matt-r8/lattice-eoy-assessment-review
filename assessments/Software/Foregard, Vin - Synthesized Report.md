<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

**1. Strengthened Team Collaboration and Feedback Loops Through Pairing**
I encouraged sharing feedback at the end of each session on what went well, what could be improved, and possible next steps. Creating space for both pros and deltas helped surface blockers early and kept communication open. This improved alignment, accelerated decision making, and supported healthier collaboration across the developers. I also contributed to clearer code organization, naming conventions, and documentation, which made shared work easier to maintain. These efforts supported Rise8’s values around feedback and a growth mindset. 




**2. Delivered End-to-End Features Across Multiple Teams and Domains**
Throughout the year, I contributed to both Blitzar and Nebula (formerly Mission Workup), working across frontend, backend, and database layers to deliver features such as event polling, authorization workflows, and CRUD operations. Switching between projects required rapid context shifting, domain learning, and adapting to different workflows and stakeholders. In some cases, such as building the SMTP service in Java, I stayed with problems until I found a solution, even when integration requirements were unclear at first. This helped move both projects toward production outcomes and supported Rise8’s ability to shift resources to priority work without losing momentum. 




**3. Improved Testing and CI/CD Reliability**
I restructured the GitLab pipeline to support feature flag testing using separate jobs with clean environments. This resolved exit handling issues and made the testing flow clearer and easier to maintain. I also identified gaps in the acceptance testing process and proposed lightweight improvements to create more consistency and confidence before release.




These accomplishments reflect Rise8’s values of outcomes in production, no unnecessary rules, and a growth mindset. They contributed to mission impact while helping improve team efficiency and delivery practices.

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Peter Duong:**
Vin is an outstanding engineer who likes to get his hands dirty in the codebase immediately. He has a strong set of opinions but loosely held, adapting to team agreements and practices. Vin gives feedback on situations but is a team player that goes with what the team evenly decides on as a whole. He is not afraid to take on challenging tasks, taking notes along the way, and share his learnings with teammates.




I'm extremely proud of Vin being able to switch context and support two teams when called for. He provided significant value to the other team to help them achieve their last minute requirements that was given by stakeholders.




Vin has a great personality and is always enjoyable to pair with.

**Nick Eissler:**
I strongly agree that I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.  Vin has shown strong technical skills, quickly ramping up to both the work on Blitzar and Kahless and has made valuable contributions to both.  He has demonstrated his commitment to doing right by Rise8 by twice jumping onto the mission workup team to assist with deadlines/people outages.  Even while supporting the other team, he made a consistent effort to stay connected with our team and our progress, seamlessly reintegrating when returning.  Vin also brought back valuable insights from his experience working in the Kahless system, including processes and knowledge of the microservice ecosystem implemented, which helped improve our own team's understanding and velocity.  Vin is also great to pair with, as he is highly collaborative and responsive to feedback.  He brings valuable perspective from his past experience, and I've personally learned useful patterns and tips from working with him.

**Cason Brinson:**
I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser due to his exceptional dedication and strong professional trajectory. Vin possesses robust learning agility, a genuine willingness to grow, and consistent motivation to drive tasks to completion. He has repeatedly demonstrated the capacity to analyze challenging problems and diverse technology stacks, and effectively formulate and execute solutions. His inherent drive for efficient task delivery directly contributes to maintaining high team velocity. Furthermore, Vin exhibits a remarkable ability to onboard quickly, proven by his seamless and rapid contribution while shifting focus multiple times between the Blitzar and Mission Workup applications.**** Based on these strong results and his proactive approach to development, I would rehire Vin.

**Damon Redding:**
Vin has been an exceptional asset to our team. At his level, it's not just about capability, but the manner in which he executes. Vin excels through transparency, thoughtfulness, and collaboration, both within and across disciplines. His seamless transition backfilling Norman ensured the Quake team maintained momentum without missing a beat. Vin's curiosity and team spirit are evident in his proactive engagement with user research and design, areas outside his primary discipline. He consistently asks insightful questions and remains composed under pressure. His commitment to our mission and reliability make him an invaluable team member.

**Ian Sperry:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Vin because he is the definition of a "mission first" contributor and an immediate force multiplier on our team. Since joining, he has knocked it out of the park with his adaptability, technical depth, and eagerness to tackle the hardest problems.




Vin embodies flexibility. He immediately fit into our culture and proved to be an invaluable asset by surging to the Mission Workup team without hesitation, jumping into a completely different tech stack and CI/CD pipeline. The fact that his efforts helped "rescue the program" speaks volumes about his impact and dedication.




He is a great problem solver, especially under pressure and ambiguity. His ability to dive deep into a new codebase and successfully figure out the source of "weird behavior" shows he's not just a surface-level coder, but a smart contributor capable of articulating complex insights.




He is a smart and dependable contributor who has already proven he can achieve outcomes in production while embodying our company values.

**Darla McGraw:**
Vin is a highly valued and reliable team player who consistently delivers and demonstrates exceptional commitment to the success of multiple teams.




For the last several months, Vin has shown outstanding dedication to the broader organization by splitting his time between the Quake and Mission Work Up teams. This effort not only back-filled critical engineering capacity to ensure both teams met their commitments but also allowed him to serve as a key conduit for knowledge transfer. He successfully integrated learnings and best practices across both teams, making them collectively stronger.




Vin is highly proactive in his approach to project execution. He is reliably vocal about technical derisking early in the process and provides clear, actionable feedback when needed. This focus on communication and mitigating risks makes him a consistently dependable contributor and a great partner for improving overall team quality and stability.

**Minh Nguyen:**
Despite only working with us for a little more than six weeks, your contribution was absolutely critical to delivering the ARA form and helping us achieving our PI8 goal. You caught up on project context and problem statements extremely fast, proving yourself to be a highly effective engineer. Your technical capability was evident when you even provided valuable SQL pointers to Edwin. You are a pleasure to work with—relaxed, fun, and a great fit—and I would enthusiastically welcome you back to the team anytime, and keep you forever :).

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Peter Duong:**
Continue sharing your feedback and opinions on patterns we can improve, both in the codebase and even our dev practices of pairing methods, etc.




For the next stage of growth, I would like to see you lead full end-to-end architecture for new services and apply those skill sets and opinions. Including cloud services, cloud architecture, and container orchestrations.

**Nick Eissler:**
**Keep:**
Keep developing your strong engineering skills, your commitment to collaborating, and your Rise8 first mindset




**Start:**
Lean more into outcome ownership. Your engineering depth is a huge strength, and pairing it with a stronger focus on user needs and driving toward the simplest viable solution before going deep technically will increase your impact.

**Cason Brinson:**
Start: I would recommend Vin start asking for feedback when pairing with others and also give his own feedback to his pair during the session.
Keep: Vin is good at explaining his thoughts as he works and pairs which is nice for both parties. He also has a want to learn or research new topics he comes across which is a great desire and skill to have with our work.
Stop: I would recommend Vin plan out his implementation approach with with pair before jumping into coding. sudo code or just a rough outline of a plan would help both parties be aligned on final goals and what stage of his solution idea they are in.

**Damon Redding:**
- No notes

**Ian Sperry:**
Keep living the "mission first" mentality. Vin should continue to show his cross-functional flexibility, both by diving into unfamiliar codebases and by being willing to help surge other teams when the mission demands it. He should also continue to invest time in deep problem-solving within new codebases.




Start getting involved in Rise8 knowledge sharing. Now that he's onboarded and comfortable, he has a ton of high-value, practical experience to share, especially around problem-solving in new codebases and CI/CD pipelines. He could start by preparing a short presentation or "RiseU" for the broader engineering community.




There is nothing Vin should stop doing at this time. He is already operating at an extremely high level and is a model for how a new team member should contribute.

**Darla McGraw:**
Continue leveraging cross-team knowledge. Your ability to effectively transfer learnings and best practices between the Quake and Mission Work Up teams is a high-value contribution. This demonstrates a strong commitment to team-wide improvement and stability.

**Minh Nguyen:**
**Start**
Ditching Blitzar and joining our team :)
Aiming for that senior role, you are more than capable
**Keep**
Your work composure. You are very fun and relaxing to work with, and I also enjoy the mini topics/thoughts you brought to the Software Engineers meetings
