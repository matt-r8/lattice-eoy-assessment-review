  "start_stop_keep": "**David Alvarado:**\nPlease keep doing what you are doing, I have enjoyed working with you\n\n**Pooja Jhaveri:**\nTo be a more collaborative and team-focused Riser, I would suggest you **start** communicating ideas and code changes early and more effectively. I would like to see you **stop** the tendency (that we all have, naturally) to allow context to be siloed on individual tracks that you are working on. Taking a more transparent and collaborative role on the team, intentionally communicating critical changes and passing along context earlier in the development, will help us all work better collectively. Lastly, please **keep** expressing your opinions and pushing things forward to help drive our team's performance. It's great working with you and glad to have you on the team!\n\n**Jesse Wilkins:**\n- Start: contributing to team conversations more and asking for help when needed\n- Stop: jumping to conclusions without all the data\n- Keep: taking ownership of work and being a strategic thinker on how to best accomplish it\n\n**Drew McFarland:**\n**START:** Getting more involved in prioritization conversations. There have been times where I could tell you didn't agree with how we prioritized our work, but you never said anything in the meeting. If you think we're going down the wrong path, speak up.\n**STOP:** Holding back your opinions when you clearly have something to say. I can tell when you're biting your tongue, and it doesn't help anyone. Just share what you're thinking.\n**CONTINUE:** Being the person who knows the answer to everything. Seriously, your knowledge is incredible and you're always able to point us toward a solution. That expertise makes you invaluable to work with.\n",
