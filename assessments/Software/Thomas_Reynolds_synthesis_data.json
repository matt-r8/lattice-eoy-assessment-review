  "accomplishments": "1. Delivering G8way to Space Force. Despite the contract not being extended/continued I believe we showed Space Force that there are significant improvements that can be made to current processes and hopefully helped open a door for Rise8 to work within Space Force more in the future.\n2. Delivering GR8 (TAK App) in code challenge. It was a difficult challenge and I believe we delivered an amazing prototype despite numerous technical issues.\n3. Integrating AI into my development workflow. This is a smaller accomplishment than the other 2 and is still ongoing but beginning to use AI as a \"pair\" has already saved me a ton of time completing smaller coding tasks and helped me brainstorm solutions to complex problems.",
  "enps_comments": "**Kevan Mordan:**\nThomas stepped it up while on TAK and was key to being successful for our WinTAK submission. He put in the work and time, but sometimes he needed a push or guidance. He was also open and proactive about feedback the entire time.\n\n**Michael Maye:**\n**Yes \u2014 absolutely!**\nThey bring a rare combination of deep technical capability, broad full-stack proficiency, and consistent ownership over whatever problem they take on. Throughout the year, we partnered closely on both the internal website and the WinTak prototype, and they demonstrated reliability and impact at every stage. Their ability to move fluidly between frontend, backend, and systems-level complexity was instrumental to the success of both projects.\nOn WinTak in particular, they were the only other engineer on the effort and carried significant portions of the technical workload. Their contributions directly shaped the quality of the prototype and played a major role in its success with the customer. They\u2019re the kind of teammate you want on high-ambiguity, high-stakes work \u2014 steady, thoughtful, and technically fearless.\nTheir presence raises the baseline of the team, I would rehire them any day.\n\n**Basudev Rijal:**\nThomas, is the coolest software engineer i ever worked with. He is a great engineer , a great mentor and very  proficient in soft skills.\n\n**Jacobi Ayala:**\nThomas was always willing to put in the hours on hard problems to get them fixed. I didn't always agree with the approach, but he did produce outcomes and I can't deny that. I would work with him again and even agreed to once when an opportunity came across that didn't come to fruition.\n\n**Matt O'Donnell:**\nThomas was a pleasure to work with. He consistently shared insightful perspectives on the work and never shied away from a challenge. He was open about discussing the obstacles he encountered, asked thoughtful questions, and genuinely respected the back-and-forth needed to troubleshoot problems. He always made himself available and consistently made my job easier by providing meaningful insight into the issues we were tackling.\n\n**Jonathan Van Dalen:**\nI have limited experience with Thomas directly, as I primarily worked with Kevan as the engineer anchor on the TAK 8-week project. So I would leave it to his engineer peers to evaluate his performance with the actual dev tasks. My responses are based on meeting interactions and pairing for design review only.\n\n\n\n\nIn that experience, our interactions were good, kind, and positive. It was clear and easy to work with him.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Kevan Mordan:**\nStart: Communicating more, especially in tight turnaround deadlines\nStop: Waiting before escalating, be noisier when you need information or clarity\nKeep: Showing up like how you finished TAK.\n\n**Basudev Rijal:**\ncontinue being awesome.\n\n**Jacobi Ayala:**\nStart working on a work life balance. I feel like sometimes Thomas just goes way too hard and needs to go at a more maintainable pace so it doesn't impact his mood or health.\n\n\n\n\nI don't have a good stop recommendation.\n\n\n\n\nKeep improving soft skills like feedback and communication with juniors and peers.\n\n**Matt O'Donnell:**\nIt\u2019s difficult to give full recommendations for the coming year since my interactions with him were brief, but based on what I saw, I would encourage him to keep bringing forward his questions, especially the challenges the rest of the team might not notice. I\u2019d also recommend that he continue looking ahead at the work with an eye toward mitigating risks. He was consistently easy to work with, especially in the engineer\u2013designer dynamic, and he made it comfortable to ask questions. I hope he continues that approach moving forward.\n\n**Jonathan Van Dalen:**\nI don't have enough context working directly with Thomas to say much about his dev work, but again my limited experience was good. I don't have enough context to specifically say what to start or stop. I would keep the clear, positive communication and pairing.\n",
