**Comment**:
> I have been experiencing a huge learning curve in joining the Bifrost Platform team, and while I have been enjoying learning so much, I have had to step back from being a leader on the OSIT/Webdart teams to being an apprentice at platform engineering. While having Graham on the team was awesome, I do see an opportunity to be more of a leader on the team with him leaving, and I intend to help fill that hole. I always contribute to team practices including mini feedback sessions, pairing rotation, and sharing knowledge and responsibilities.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Start: Taking on more leadership on the Bifrost team. Take the time to understand our architecture, strategy, and dependencies, so that I can contribute at my best level. Deepen my understanding of the problem space and the solution we are developing.
- Stop: Don’t rush through a task without understanding it - don’t be afraid to tell my pair that I need to take a step back to see where we are going. Use AI, but make sure to refer to technical documentation as the source of truth when it makes sense to.
- Continue: Learning as much as possible - try to finish my CKAD course and get certified by the end of the year. Continue getting better at reading technical documentation. Continue doing deep research on technologies that are new to me.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - I replatformed (rebuilt) the WeBDARt application on the SpOC contract as the only engineer, using a technology that was entirely new to me (Warp Core). When stakeholders were concerned about slow processing time on WeBDARt, I identified the Palantir bug which prevented faster processing time initially, refactored the code from python to typescript so that I could use a different Palantir repo to circumvent the bug, and refactored the implementation and architecture of the core app functionality, taking processing time from 8 minutes to a few seconds. This was a high visibility success which left a great impression on 2 of our highest level stakeholders on the SpOC Contract: SpOC Director of Innovation, Paul Contoveros, and Deputy Director of Innovation, Lt Col Homan (JJ). They were so excited about the optimization that they went up to Abel Hernandez, my PM, at Prodacity and asked: "Do you know Delaney Coveno? We heard about her optimizing the processing time; that was a concern for us and the operations folks. That's huge! We heard it took up to 8 minutes and is now just a few seconds. Is she here?"
- Getting OSIT to production. I joined the OSIT team and quickly came up to speed on their architecture. We impressed our customers by getting OSIT into SIPR production, despite a grueling path to prod. Since Warp Core lacks automated testing and I felt our procedures could be improved, I also established (with help and agreement from the app team) a path from NIPR to SIPR which ensures successful handovers from developers to design/PM, and makes sure testing of any feature does not fall through the cracks. My contributions to the OSIT team laid the foundation for the outcomes in production which have improved the fidelity and availability of OPSCAP reporting.
- Contributing to the efforts to build the Bifrost platform, which has the potential for huge outcomes in production. As part of the Bifrost team, I have helped create the Bifrost platform which will onboard applications to the Mission Manager platform and streamline their ATO process.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep being open to asking clarifying questions. It helps me and probably others understand the actual topic at hand in more layman's terms. Sometimes the discussions are going way to fast and you typing in chat what an acronym means or actually pausing conversation clarifies and aligns the conversation. 




You also speak up when it seems like someone is not being heard/their opinion is not really getting through. By rephrasing their sentences you will continue to help others get their point across and not glossed over. 




Sometimes when we pair it feels like we get side tracked on identifying possible solutions. It makes for awkward pauses in the pairing, it would be nice to just acknowledge that we are semi soloing and put a timebox on it. Then come back and discuss our different solutions. This space is new to both of us, so it would help to do some research solo in certain scenarios.

**Comment**:
> Delaney is a highly effective problem solver. Even when joining a conversation with little or no context, she’s able to quickly understand the situation and help guide the team toward a clear path forward. Her ability to identify actionable next steps, especially when the team feels blocked or stuck, is invaluable. Delaney brings clarity, momentum, and a sense of possibility to situations that might otherwise stall, and the team benefits enormously from her presence in those moments.

> Keep bringing that calm, grounded energy to challenging conversations and tough problems. You never appear visibly shaken or overwhelmed when navigating difficult situations, and that steadiness has a noticeable positive effect on the people around you. Your composure helps the team stay focused and confident, even when the path forward isn’t obvious. I’d like to see you lead more of our strategy discussions. Your insights are always on point, and having your voice drive the conversation would add a lot of clarity and direction for the team. Don’t hesitate to step forward, you have a lot to offer.

**Comment**:
> Delaney has been a great senior engineer on the team. She will bring forward ideas that help the team work better together/more efficiently, such as switching pairs more frequently so people are able to gain more context across all the different tracks of work. She always has an openness to learn and will ask clarifying questions that help the team stay aligned during planning sessions, especially in terms of architecture and implementation. She also keeps the mission in mind, ensuring she's doing valuable work when she's not able to pair with another engineer. She's also fixed the dev container, which allowed the team to maintain the same practices with regard to the code. She's also been very willing to pair with non-engineers, which has been valuable for myself as a non-engineer.

**Comment**:
> Delaney is a very effective contributor to the engineering side of the house, asking great questions, participating closely in technical discussion, self-starter on tasks where she has little context, and picks up on topics that need additional clarifying. Pairing is also a breeze with Delaney; clear, concise communication and quickly picks up on new technologies and frameworks. I would like to see Delaney take a more rounded interest in the product in order to engage more fully in the product vision and thus help drive discussion on technical priorities

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Comment**:
> Start pairing more regularly with our PM and security counterparts to get more context on the current state of Bifrost's mission. I could definitely see your communication skills being very useful when preparing for or communicating with stakeholders. I would also look for more opportunities to facilitate discussions for the team, perhaps looks for opportunities to have a discussion on engineering practice if you felt less fit to facilitate architectural or planning discussions. Also start being more deliberate with sharing feedback or creating time to share feedback with teammates. This isn't necessarily personal to you, the Bifrost team as a whole should be doing this more.




Keep asking good questions and delivering good software. You are very good at burning down tasks at a high quality, and pairing feels consistently productive and efficient.
