## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Mases Krikorian:**
Roshni has an amazing problem-solving mindset, easy to work with, and strong technical knowledge in her field. She's a quick learning; adapting to different environments and juggling multiple responsibilities. She is an excellent decision maker, and handles high pressure situations extremely well. She works hard to ensures we deliver outcomes in production, and her history of doing so is a great example for other to follow.

**Danny Benson:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Roshni because she is a highly capable and dependable engineer whose technical contributions have been essential to the success of the team. For much of the year, she was the only engineer with access to the classified environment, and she handled that responsibility with consistency and accuracy. Her deep understanding of the OSIT product and the classified setup played a critical role in the successful COMET 2.0 integration, and she regularly provides the information and context needed for other engineers to upskill and execute effectively.




Roshni has repeatedly demonstrated strong technical competence, reliability, and the ability to deliver in high-responsibility situations. Her knowledge and steady execution make her an invaluable asset to the team, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with her again.

**Evan Mladinov:**
Roshni is a miracle worker. Over the course of this contract, we have been put in tough spots with deadlines or handling customer interactions... They have been challenging. However, I have no doubt in my mind that without Roshni, the CFC contract would not be in as good of a spot as it is today. Through all the...stuff with this contract, Roshni has kept her head high and consistently delivered efficiently. She slows down to explain technicals with others and is a great teammate to have overall. She is open to feedback and is not afraid to accept blame if and improve.

**Dan Bitter:**
I have limited experience working with Roshni because she's been needed so much on SIPR work, but it's clear that she's a leading example of what engineers should aim to become. She's exceptionally capable in Warp Core and has proven to be a lynchpin member of the team. She's inquisitive when figuring things out and has a strong work ethic to see things through. She often takes initiative and gets shit done.

**Kyle Smart:**
Roshni is one of the most talented developers on the team with some of the most experience in warpcore. She is able to tackle some of the most difficult stories and get them done quickly. She also utilizes her SIPR access to consistently ship outcomes into prod, and is willing to explain what she is doing when asked questions on it.

**Abel A A Hernandez:**
I acknowledge the significant burden you carried on this project due to being the sole team member with SIPR access for about five months. Now that Lambo, Danny, Sagar, Cory, and Kyle have obtained access, I hope your workload and expectations have become more manageable.




Regardless if you end up on an other project or remain on SpOC, the substantial domain expertise you've accumulated, in Foundry/Warpcore, Marketplaces, and more, is invaluable. 
I encourage you to transform those challenges and learnings into actionable insights for other Risers. Thinking back, what key advice or strategy would you implement differently now?

**Anthony Zubia:**
Roshni is an impactful and highly reliable engineer who played a foundational role in the successful launch and ongoing stability of the OSIT application. Her work in managing the SIPR-side deployments and releases, often as the sole accessible engineer, was a critical success factor that ensured continuity and progress for the entire product delivery.

**Cory:**
Roshni is one of the most pivotal people on this team. She is incredibly sharp and has been carrying the SIPR workload nearly entirely on her own. I would very enthusiastically rehire Roshni for her role.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Mases Krikorian:**
## Start: Embrace Elevated Leadership
You possess a rare and innate leadership aptitude that sets you apart. I believe your next step should be to fully embrace and actively seek out more expansive leadership roles. Your ability to guide any team is founded on three pillars: your deep and highly relevant industry knowledge, your exceptional interpersonal and social intelligence which fosters strong team cohesion, and an unwavering drive that ensures projects are not just completed, but executed with excellence and efficiency. You are a natural leader, and teams thrive under your direction.

**Evan Mladinov:**
Overall I think Roshni should keep doing what she is doing. 
One thing I would like her to start is to be more of a leader with the rest of the team. Although she is not the anchor, Roshni has alot (if not the most) technical context on this contract. I want to see her use that knowledge more to influence and teach others.

**Dan Bitter:**
Start
- I don't know how reasonable this is, given the SIPR workload, but Roshni can take initiative to pair with other team members to help spread the knowledge. I'm sure she has a lot of knowledge on good ways to do things, but it's only been able to surface during meetings or Slack conversations so far
- Somewhat similarly, Roshni can give feedback when appropriate. I haven't received any feedback from her and I know I have things to work on - some things as mundane as being a more engaging speaker and working on my ums / ahs / filler words.
- Roshni can consider turning her webcam on from time to time. My webcam usage varies, and tends to be off more than it's on, but it allows "conversation" even while muted with facial expressions and body language. Our clothing, home decor, and random background items can spark the water cooler conversations that we usually miss out on since we're remote. I've personally liked having video on for stand up and usually having it off the rest of the day.
Stop
- I don't have anything Roshni should stop doing at this time
Keep doing
- Being a key person responsible for a ton of the success we've had in producing OSIT and ODIE

**Kyle Smart:**
Roshni is a very talented developer which makes tackling harder stories easier to do with her as a paired programmer, and once I get the ball rolling you are easy to talk to and pair with. However, I have also noticed it can be difficult to talk to you at times which can make approaching you for help hard to do at times. It also can be difficult to follow you at times when you are moving so fast (as time goes on I anticipate that I will improve at keeping up).

**Abel A A Hernandez:**
Just FYI: This feedback should have been shared with you earlier and more often. that’s my bad.




**Start** proactively collaborating with others or on your own sharing your specialized learnings and methods across the OSIT app, Warpcore, and the Marketplace. While you share valuable knowledge when prompted, it's currently hit-or-miss. Given your unique responsibility and exposure to the SIPR process, we would benefit if you to step up as a knowledge leader, consistently enabling the team with your insights.




**Avoid/Stop** Communication that creates the impression that all teammates share your level of technical understanding, especially with non-engineers. This assumption can lead to prolonged follow-up questions or require excessive effort to understand necessary details about the work in progress or future plans. I recommend being more conscious of your audience, their level of understanding, and expertise. By proactively asking clarifying questions, you can adjust your responses to ensure optimal clarity and proactive communication when discussing technical topics.




**Keep** creating and contributing to documentation that helps the team understand the inner workings of complex platforms like Foundry and Warpcore. This commitment to knowledge transfer is incredibly valuable. Additionally, please continue keeping up open communications on Slack; it's been great seeing and hearing more from you as you share updates and insights with the team.

**Anthony Zubia:**
**Start proactively increasing project visibility:** Begin attending or presenting during client demonstrations to translate technical successes into mission value and build direct rapport with key stakeholders.




**Stop allowing complexity to impede cross-functional communication:** Focus on practicing patience and tailored communication when discussing the technical intricacies of Warp Core with less-technical peers, helping them bridge understanding gaps without frustration.




**Continue to drive critical path work:** Maintain the strong focus and execution rigor in managing and delivering all SIPR-related enhancements and releases, ensuring the critical system remains functional and compliant.

**Cory:**
Roshni is always the go-to person for anything technical and has an incredibly thorough understanding of the project. Looking at the career track, the only part that I think could benefit to work on in regard to Staff Software Engineer would be under the "Behavior" section. Specifically, focusing on team building skills like supporting feedback and intentionally coming across as being very open and available to people. Keep up the great work!
