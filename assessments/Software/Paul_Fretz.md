**Comment**:
> I believe I represented Rise8 well on the DevEnablement team this past year. I learned an extraordinary amount, and my understanding of platform engineering and DevOps has deepened significantly. Although this work was well outside my comfort zone at the start, I embraced the challenge and pushed myself to learn quickly as we navigated new concepts, tools, languages, and delivery strategies. I focused on producing real outcomes, making an impact, and growing into a stronger engineer.




I’m excited for what the next year will bring, especially as we begin collaborating more closely with the core platform team. From a cultural standpoint, our team operated cohesively and consistently upheld Rise8’s values and practices. While I could ask for formal feedback more frequently and work on being less frustrated with Lighthouse leadership, I believe our immediate team had a strong, enjoyable year together and made meaningful contributions to Lighthouse.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- Pursuing formal certifications to deepen my platform expertise. I’m close to finishing the CKA and plan to continue with additional KodeKloud courses afterward.
- Taking on more leadership responsibilities, especially with Stefan’s departure, and stepping up proactively to guide team direction when needed.
- Asking for feedback more frequently to ensure alignment, accelerate growth, and strengthen collaboration across the team.
- Increasing collaboration with the core platform team as our workstreams continue to overlap.
### **Stop**
- Letting frustration or annoyance build up too quickly. I want to focus on maintaining composure, patience, and perspective—especially in complex or ambiguous situations.
### **Keep**
- Continuously learning and sharpening my platform engineering skills across AWS, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitOps, and our broader toolchain.
- Leveraging AI strategically to accelerate development, debugging, exploration, and idea validation.
- Asking thoughtful questions, offering insights, and contributing knowledge to help the team move faster and make better decisions.
- Showing up as a core, reliable team member who produces high-quality outcomes, takes ownership, and consistently operates as an A-player.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Significant contributions to the DevEnablement team.** Despite joining with limited platform-engineering background, I became a core member of the team and contributed across the stack: building dashboards, Helm charts, development tooling for tenants, IaC infrastructure, streamlined onboarding workflows, improved observability, and a more clearly defined golden path for how tenants should navigate and adopt LHDI. I consistently aided tenants in need of help as well. 
- **Major growth in platform engineering skills.** This year I developed a deep, hands-on understanding of Terraform, Go, AWS, Backstage, OPA, Kubernetes, and related platform technologies. I also gained extensive DevOps experience, including pipeline design and management, security scanning, Argo/Vault/EKS stack operations, and Helm chart development. Concepts that used to feel abstract are now areas where I feel confident and capable.
- **Mastered practical, production-grade use of AI.** I learned how to effectively leverage AI to build multiple production dashboards for tenants—complete with backend/frontend code that surfaces real insights into best-practice adoption. I used AI extensively for debugging, skill development, problem replication, and clarifying complex topics—while maintaining a critical, healthy relationship with it. I also invested in DevContainer workflows and built an agentic framework that enables autonomous task delegation, rule-driven behavior, PRD creation, task breakdown, and implementation planning with preserved context. Using this framework, I built a full deployable ECS/ALB/VPC stack (initially with Coty, then expanded into a reusable, user-friendly toolkit). Anyone with AWS credentials and a containerized app can now run a few scripts to automatically install dependencies, deploy the infrastructure, and launch their application on the stack.

**Comment**:
> Paul is a valuable Senior Software Engineer who I would enthusiastically rehire for this role. His contributions are marked by strong technical ownership and cross-team influence. Paul consistently contributes to and drives outcomes that enhance the tenant experience and efficiency on the LHDI platform.
Specifically, Paul owned the development of several Backstage/CodeVA templates and built the frontend of the Golden Path dashboard we published. These two pieces of work contributed to necessary standardization and streamlined workflows, directly improving productivity for the tenant teams of LHDI.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep acting as a critical cross-team resource. Paul should continue to leverage his technical knowledge, perseverance, and effectiveness in pairing and debugging with tenant teams. This direct interaction is key to fulfilling our role as the dev enablement team and is vital for accelerating development on LHDI. Paul should also continue to drive his platform skills forward. Studying for and obtaining the CKA is a great goal and clear way to increase his confidence and technical depth on LHDI. 
Stop waiting for feedback requests from teammates or practice/delivery leads. Paul provides quality feedback when asked, but it would be great to see Paul proactively provide constructive feedback to teammates when he notices anything, rather than taking a reactive approach.
Paul should start instituting a personal rhythm for soliciting and providing structured feedback. This will ensure continuous growth from himself and his peers. Paul should start utilizing dedicated active listening techniques during critical discussions to maximize communication and team efficiency. His desire to quickly contribute solutions is a strength, but taking a brief pause to listen to fully understand the core problem will ensure all key points of questions are answered and ultimately lead to better outcomes.
