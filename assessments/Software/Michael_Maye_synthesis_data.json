  "accomplishments": "**1. Resurrecting the EKS Production Environment & Building a New Foundation**\n**Situation:** The internal employee site\u2019s EKS cluster went down, impacting production access and threatening ongoing work. I had no prior AWS/Kubernetes experience, and platform had no bandwidth to respond.\n**Task:** Diagnose and restore production service stability without existing Terraform/Helm configs, while minimizing impact on operations.\n**Action:**\n- Worked late nights for nearly a week to self-teach AWS, EKS, ECS, load balancers, and virtual networking.\n- Traced obscure target group registration failures to deprecated instance types after days of deep investigation.\n- Validated a fix in staging, updated instance type configurations, and restored the cluster.\n- Implemented a circuit-breaker fallback in GitHub Actions to prevent repeat outages.\n- Began leading the migration from EKS Self-Managed to ECS to eliminate root causes entirely.\n**Result:**\n- Full restoration of production with **zero data loss**.\n- **Reduced operational burden** on the platform team by owning the migration.\n- **Improved future time-to-restore** through workflow improvements.\n- Established a stable ECS foundation that other applications can now deploy on with minimal setup.\n\n\n\n\n**2. Unblocking the WinTAK Prototype Through Deep Technical Investigation**\n**Situation:** A core KMZ export feature was producing geographically misaligned output, threatening the success of the building-detection prototype.\n**Task:** Fix an issue that had no documentation, no examples, and no clear root cause\u2014under a tight delivery window.\n**Action:**\n- Decompiled and traced WinTAK code paths to understand undocumented projection logic.\n- Validated MapGL\u2019s projection functions and reverse-projection accuracy.\n- Diagnosed subtle pixel-coordinate misalignment between MapGL and GL capture systems.\n- Implemented a corrective transformation that made outputs accurate enough for the AI SDK to function reliably.\n**Result:**\n- **Unblocked core feature of prototype**, enabling an on-time delivery with accurate building detections.\n- Prevented a likely failed customer review of WinTak and potential loss of confidence.\n- Demonstrated significant growth in autonomy, technical depth, and problem-solving under ambiguity.\n\n\n\n\n**3. Sustaining High Performance Through a 7-Month Active Duty Training Period and Seamless Reintegration**\n**Situation:**\nI was required to transition to a 7-month active-duty training cycle as part of my military service, attending full-time cybersecurity analyst instruction: 8 hours of high-intensity classroom work daily, combined with military duties and performance expectations.\n**Task:**\nRemain a contributing member of Rise8, support ongoing internal initiatives, and ensure a smooth return to full-time engineering work\u2014without letting either commitment slip in quality.\n**Action:**\n- Maintained part-time contributions to an internal project during the entire training period, staying engaged with the team and continuing to ship meaningful work.\n- Balanced full-time military academic load with professional responsibilities, continuously communicating status, delivering work asynchronously, and remaining available for key discussions.\n- Graduated **top of my class**, demonstrating mastery of new cybersecurity knowledge while upholding Rise8 quality and reliability.\n- Immediately reintegrated into full-time engineering upon return, joining the WinTAK project and quickly delivering high-complexity contributions that helped the team achieve a successful final prototype.\n**Result:**\n- Demonstrated **exceptional grit and consistency**, maintaining performance in two high-demand environments simultaneously.\n- Preserved team continuity and momentum during an extended part-time period.\n- Returned to Rise8 at full speed, with **zero ramp-up time**, contributing immediately to mission-critical work.\n- Strengthened the company\u2019s cybersecurity posture with newly acquired, formally trained expertise.\nThis accomplishment shows that even under extreme external demands, I remained aligned with the mission, upheld Rise8 standards, and continued delivering high-impact outcomes without compromise.",
  "enps_comments": "**Kevan Mordan:**\nMichael needs to step it up with communication and involvement, or more transparent with the reality of his situation. I can't provide much feedback on his core SWE fundamentals, but would have liked to see more.\n\n**Thomas Reynolds:**\nMichael does the work he is assigned regardless of complexity or difficulty. I would like to see him be more open and honest about timelines and his understanding of how to solve the problems he encounters. I would be happy to rehire him for his role with an understanding that he is still growing as an engineer.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\nMichael takes on challenging, open-ended tasks cooly and with determination. He is honest about his skillsets and limitations, but doesn't let that hold him back from learning and growing eagerly. Michael's a fun teammate to work with in these challenging situations, and he really puts in the legwork to get the tough tasks done.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Kevan Mordan:**\nStart - Communicating availability and status more\nStop - Spinning your tires before asking for help or clarity, be noisier sooner\nKeep - Having a positive attitude\n\n**Thomas Reynolds:**\n- Start: Being more open, communicating and sharing more. Come up with ideas for improvement or refactoring and bring them up with your teams. Even if they aren't accepted, it can generate more ideas and lead to a better product and will help you think more critically about the work you're doing.\n- Stop: Not asking for help. If you get stuck on something for a long time, reach out and ask for help.\n- Keep: Looking for opportunities to grow and improve your skillset. Sometimes just stepping back to look at a problem without jumping straight to the \"best practice\" solution can help you think critically and grow through trying new solutions.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\n- Keep demonstrating that fearless attitude in the face of uncertainty; despite being handed a major complicated, unfamiliar migration of Rise8 infrastructure from EKS to ECS, you worked tirelessly to understand the situation and implement an effective solution\n",
