  "employee_name": "Minh Nguyen",
  "accomplishments": "The team and I deployed improvements to the Wideband Mission Workup application that drove a mission-critical **47% reduction** in request acceptance time (7h 18m to 3h 55m). This **Outcome in Production** was delivered in 145 days, significantly beating the 180-day commitment.\n\n\n\n\nAlong with the team, I delivered the **Automated Resource Authorization (ARA) form** within Mission Workup, streamlining the authorization process. This crucial, program-wide functionality was built and deployed in just **four weeks**, demonstrating exceptional agility and grit.\n\n\n\n\nI developed and shared an **AI-assisted DORA metrics automation script** across Rise8 Engineering. This tool helped our team (and hopefully other teams) to provide a better report and self evaluation within the engineering practices.",
  "enps_comments": "**Roshni Patel:**\nMinh is an absolute pleasure to work with. He\u2019s incredibly collaborative, always willing to jump in, share his expertise, and help the team navigate complex challenges. On top of that, his responsiveness is unmatched\u2014whenever there\u2019s a question, issue, or urgent request, Minh is there with thoughtful guidance and solutions. His support and steady presence make a huge difference for the team every day.\n\n**Hannah Cheng:**\nMinh is a standout contributor who consistently delivers the impact of a Senior Software Engineer, despite not yet holding the title. He demonstrated immense courage, grit, and commitment by volunteering as the team\u2019s Engineer Anchor, a role he stepped into without prior experience and has executed with dedication that exceeds expectations. He acts proactively in the product domain, often taking the lead on drafting stories and clarifying requirements to ensure alignment. I appreciate his outcome-oriented approach; he embodies a \"strong opinions, loosely held\" mindset that makes him a flexible and effective collaborator. Furthermore, Minh fills critical gaps by taking on unassigned tasks, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.\n\n**Edwin Karaya:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Minh. He is the anchor engineer for our team, consistently reliable, and deeply knowledgeable about the mission and the Kahless system. He contributes meaningfully to both technical and mission clarity, communicates exceptionally well, and is always willing to pair or support teammates. His calm presence, visual communication skills, and ability to explain planner workflows make him invaluable. Minh is an A Player teammate who strengthens team culture and elevates the people around him.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nMinh is an essential member of the MW team and operates at a Team Leader level. He brings deep domain knowledge and demonstrates consistent ownership of product development, often making proactive decisions to move work forward. He was instrumental in helping me onboard getting me set up with relevant stories and context, and offering to pair anytime there were blockers or ambiguity in designs or requirements. Minh plays a critical lead/support role for the team, and is often the go to person for both context and delivery execution.\n\n\n\n\nHe consistently shows a \u201ccan do\u201d attitude, delivers on urgent requirements, and sets realistic expectations with stakeholders. His impact goes beyond individual contributions, he anchors the team and helps ensure delivery stays on track. Based on my experience, I would absolutely rehire him for this role.\n\n**Peter Duong:**\nMinh is an exceptionally competent engineer who consistently demonstrates a bias for action and reliable delivery, particularly under pressure. He proved this during the EM&C PI8 when he immediately took the lead to guide his team in developing a large, last-minute feature, successfully delivering it within a short timeframe despite the team being newly onboarded to the codebase. This rapid execution demonstrates he is a quick learner dedicated to mission success.\n\n\n\n\nFurthermore, his calm and friendly personality enables highly efficient pairing and effective collaboration across the team. His professional demeanor and ability to communicate complex topics make him a strong technical ambassador, often serving as the presenter or speaker for critical discussions and presentations (such as Wideband Mission Workup). This presence secures clarity and confidence among stakeholders.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Roshni Patel:**\n**Start:**\n- Start sharing more of your long-term technical vision during planning. Your depth of knowledge and foresight are huge strengths, and bringing more of that into early conversations would help the team better anticipate complexity and tradeoffs.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep:**\n- Keep being the steady, reliable anchor the team depends on. Your clarity, structure, and ability to explain complex technical needs make an enormous difference.\n- Keep bringing your thoughtful, collaborative approach. You create a grounded, supportive environment that makes it easy for everyone to do their best work.\n\n**Hannah Cheng:**\n**Keep:** Continue being mission-driven and deeply involved across product domains; your ability to bridge the gap between code and product requirements is rare. Please also keep leveraging AI in your workflows, as it is clearly amplifying your efficiency. \n\n\n\n\n**Start:** Start recognizing yourself as a leader on this team. You are already doing the work of a Senior Engineer; continue to own that space confidently.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\n**Start:** Working on communication clarity and knowledge transfer, particularly when conveying complex ideas to teammates or stakeholders. Being more intentional here could help others learn from you and position you for broader influence.\n**Stop:** Be mindful of relying too heavily on Claude or AI tools for implementation. They\u2019re incredibly effective for accelerating work and you've clearly used them well to deliver quickly, but continuing to mix in hands on exploration will help keep your creative and critical thinking skills sharp. Striking that balance will only make your instincts stronger over time.\n**Continue:** Leading by example with a positive, delivery focused mindset. Continue taking initiative on ambiguous work, helping teammates onboard, and proactively shaping product outcomes. Your presence is deeply felt on the team. Keep doing what you\u2019re doing.\n\n**Peter Duong:**\nKeep up the intense commitment and dedication to mission delivery that you demonstrated by leading your team to successfully complete that large, last-minute feature. Your bias for action is a critical team asset.\n\n\n\n\nStart sharing the ownership of story testing and final acceptance responsibility with your product team. This strategic delegation is crucial for your growth, as it will enforce process maturity and empower the product team to own and verify the acceptance criteria. This shift will free up your time to focus on higher-level engineering strategy, technical debt, and architectural planning for future efforts.\n",
