**Comment**:
> As an anchor, I **successfully supported the Wideband Mission Workup team to reach our outcome in production goal**, delivering a **47% reduction in mission request cycle time (7h 18m to 3h 55m)** in 145 days, significantly exceeding the 180-day delivery timeline. My influence extends to the organization as I created and shared the **DORA metrics script** across Rise8 Engineering, helping to ease the reporting process. I have acted as a high-leverage leader, providing technical context via **EventStorming, coaching**, and communicating programming limitations to our product team so their design can adhere to the existing pattern while still supporting the users' need.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For the next year, my plan is focused on scaling my technical impact and process maturity. 
**Start:** 
Investigating and championing actionable steps to reduce our four-month product release cycle, focusing on continuous delivery practices. 
Learning more about ways I can leverage AI to improve our productivity, not just within the engineering department, but also on the product side (writing Jira stories, figma diagrams, etc.)
Improving my tech stack to be able to provide a better solution for future problems we might encounter, or just to be ready for future projects.
**Stop:** 
Establishing and enforcing clear scope boundaries with stakeholders at the start of each cycle.
**Keep:** 
Leveraging the AI-assisted workflow and improving the DORA metrics script to sustain the organizational efficiency gains 
Maintaining the use of EventStorming diagrams and coaching to ensure the team remains a high-velocity, high-context unit.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> The team and I deployed improvements to the Wideband Mission Workup application that drove a mission-critical **47% reduction** in request acceptance time (7h 18m to 3h 55m). This **Outcome in Production** was delivered in 145 days, significantly beating the 180-day commitment.




Along with the team, I delivered the **Automated Resource Authorization (ARA) form** within Mission Workup, streamlining the authorization process. This crucial, program-wide functionality was built and deployed in just **four weeks**, demonstrating exceptional agility and grit.




I developed and shared an **AI-assisted DORA metrics automation script** across Rise8 Engineering. This tool helped our team (and hopefully other teams) to provide a better report and self evaluation within the engineering practices.

**Comment**:
> Minh is a standout contributor who consistently delivers the impact of a Senior Software Engineer, despite not yet holding the title. He demonstrated immense courage, grit, and commitment by volunteering as the team’s Engineer Anchor, a role he stepped into without prior experience and has executed with dedication that exceeds expectations. He acts proactively in the product domain, often taking the lead on drafting stories and clarifying requirements to ensure alignment. I appreciate his outcome-oriented approach; he embodies a "strong opinions, loosely held" mindset that makes him a flexible and effective collaborator. Furthermore, Minh fills critical gaps by taking on unassigned tasks, ensuring nothing falls through the cracks.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep:** Continue being mission-driven and deeply involved across product domains; your ability to bridge the gap between code and product requirements is rare. Please also keep leveraging AI in your workflows, as it is clearly amplifying your efficiency. 




**Start:** Start recognizing yourself as a leader on this team. You are already doing the work of a Senior Engineer; continue to own that space confidently.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- **Driving story refinement with more confidence.** You already know the mission extremely well; leaning into that during backlog refinement will help shape clearer stories for the team.
- **Taking on opportunities for broader ownership.** You’re already a strong anchor engineer. Continuing to grow toward owning larger features or workflows end to end will accelerate your path toward Senior-level responsibility.
### **Stop**
- **Shouldering too much of the context alone.** You often carry deep mission knowledge. Finding small moments to document or share those insights will reduce bottlenecks and help others scale with you.
### **Keep**
- **Creating visuals and diagrams that clarify complex workflows.** Your Figma diagrams and workflow models consistently improve the team’s understanding and help stakeholders communicate better.
- **Being calm, patient, and easy to work with.** Your demeanor sets the tone for healthy collaboration and creates a supportive environment.
- **Pairing generously and helping the team understand both the app and the mission.** You raise the entire team’s performance by sharing context and explaining planner workflows.
- **Taking feedback well and integrating it quickly.** This is one of your biggest strengths and will fuel your growth into more senior responsibilities.
- **Catching workflow and requirement issues before they become bigger problems.** Your mission awareness directly prevents mistakes and improves planner experience.

**Comment**:
> Minh is an essential member of the MW team and operates at a Team Leader level. He brings deep domain knowledge and demonstrates consistent ownership of product development, often making proactive decisions to move work forward. He was instrumental in helping me onboard getting me set up with relevant stories and context, and offering to pair anytime there were blockers or ambiguity in designs or requirements. Minh plays a critical lead/support role for the team, and is often the go to person for both context and delivery execution.




He consistently shows a “can do” attitude, delivers on urgent requirements, and sets realistic expectations with stakeholders. His impact goes beyond individual contributions, he anchors the team and helps ensure delivery stays on track. Based on my experience, I would absolutely rehire him for this role.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:** Working on communication clarity and knowledge transfer, particularly when conveying complex ideas to teammates or stakeholders. Being more intentional here could help others learn from you and position you for broader influence.
**Stop:** Be mindful of relying too heavily on Claude or AI tools for implementation. They’re incredibly effective for accelerating work and you've clearly used them well to deliver quickly, but continuing to mix in hands on exploration will help keep your creative and critical thinking skills sharp. Striking that balance will only make your instincts stronger over time.
**Continue:** Leading by example with a positive, delivery focused mindset. Continue taking initiative on ambiguous work, helping teammates onboard, and proactively shaping product outcomes. Your presence is deeply felt on the team. Keep doing what you’re doing.

**Comment**:
> Minh is an exceptionally competent engineer who consistently demonstrates a bias for action and reliable delivery, particularly under pressure. He proved this during the EM&C PI8 when he immediately took the lead to guide his team in developing a large, last-minute feature, successfully delivering it within a short timeframe despite the team being newly onboarded to the codebase. This rapid execution demonstrates he is a quick learner dedicated to mission success.




Furthermore, his calm and friendly personality enables highly efficient pairing and effective collaboration across the team. His professional demeanor and ability to communicate complex topics make him a strong technical ambassador, often serving as the presenter or speaker for critical discussions and presentations (such as Wideband Mission Workup). This presence secures clarity and confidence among stakeholders.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep up the intense commitment and dedication to mission delivery that you demonstrated by leading your team to successfully complete that large, last-minute feature. Your bias for action is a critical team asset.




Start sharing the ownership of story testing and final acceptance responsibility with your product team. This strategic delegation is crucial for your growth, as it will enforce process maturity and empower the product team to own and verify the acceptance criteria. This shift will free up your time to focus on higher-level engineering strategy, technical debt, and architectural planning for future efforts.
