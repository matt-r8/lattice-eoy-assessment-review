  "accomplishments": "1. Pioneered User-Friendly Remote Development Environments at Rise8 - Leading the charge on and and working through kinks with GitHub Codespaces on R&D enabled a nonzero number of product owners with no intimate familiarity with git to leverage Claude Code in an easy-to-use and secure environment. If you've ever tried to have to explain git AND get someone outside of engineering to download the right stuff etc to get it all working, you may recognize how actually impactful this work was to the vision of getting all product people to become fluent with AI coding. I look forward to helping standardize remote development environments when we transition to GitLab also to avoid any of the silly headaches engineers might otherwise have to worry about with respect to developing and executing code on the same physical hardware that they need for using Slack and Chrome. \n2. First Full-stack AI-produced Project Bid at Rise8 - I produced the very first functioning proof-of-concept full-stack app submission for a VA project bid with a hilariously tight turnaround time from a one-shot prompt with Claude Code. The only time a project bid was sent over to the R&D team during my tenure there was one where we had less than a week to create a full-stack app and produce a 10-page writeup etc - something that five years ago would have been completely impractical to turn around without a real justification for the last-minute nature of the task. I didn't have access to the company decision-makers who thought this was a reasonable thing to take on or any context on how often these sorts of rapid-fire last-minute bids come across our desk, but I knew enough about AI coding and am elite enough to identify where Claude fails miserably and where it's super-helpful to nearly-perfectly shoot the gap of getting something produced and within spec within the requested turnaround time. A further iteration on the frontend with Jonathan Van Dalen allowed us to really push Claude to hone the design right where it needed to be. I have no idea whether the bid was accepted or what ultimately ended up happening with it, and so therefore it is in hindsight indistinguishable from a mere test, but I demonstrated to myself that I'm easily top 0.01% of engineers in the world who understand vibe coding and can wield these crazy powerful AI tools and that experience alone was worth it to me :)\n3. Helped Secure AI Devcontainer - Security being the top priority that it always is and especially in a world where AI systems are not guaranteed to avoid scheming against their users, it was imperative to set up regular vulnerability scans of the container we were using and wire up GitHub Actions to rebuild and publish an updated container upon discovery of a CVE and the relevant patch in the tools we use (claude, goose, etc). I was able to put my familiarity with GitHub, actions, etc and my fundamental AI doomer outlook to productive use in these efforts to put security top of mind as part of our development here at Rise8.",
  "enps_comments": "**Mike Gehard:**\nDuring our time working together on the R&D team, I found it challenging to maintain visibility into your work and ensure alignment. In our XP environment, we rely heavily on frequent communication and rapid feedback loops. I needed to see more frequent pull requests, proactive check-ins when assumptions needed validation (especially on underspecified stories), and regular updates on progress. \n\n\n\n\nThere were several instances where work took longer than expected without visible progress or communication about blockers, and times when deliverables didn't match expectations because assumptions weren't validated upfront. While I appreciate your curiosity about new technologies like AI-assisted development, succeeding in this type of environment requires much more frequent communication and collaboration than I observed during our time together.\n\n**Tom Anastasio:**\nAs a disclaimer, my pairing with Ryan was limited, spanning only a couple of weeks, but it was highly impactful.\n\n\n\n\nDuring that time, I was attempting complex coding tasks despite not being a coder. Ryan was **exceptionally patient, responsive, and supportive**. He guided me through every step, explaining simple and basic concepts in a way that ensured I learned without ever feeling inadequate or rushed.\n\n\n\n\nI deeply appreciated his **kind and friendly demeanor** and his consistent support. Even in a short period, he demonstrated that he is a **very smart individual** with a lot of **patience** and a knack for developing **creative solutions** to everyday technical problems. I wish I had had the opportunity to work with him more extensively.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Mike Gehard:**\n**Start:**\n- **Submitting frequent, small PRs** - In XP environments, aim for daily or every 1-2 days rather than large PRs after extended periods\n- **Proactively validating assumptions before starting work** - When stories are underspecified (e.g., one sentence), schedule a quick sync before beginning implementation to ensure alignment\n- **Providing regular progress updates** - Use standups, Slack, or quick check-ins to communicate what you're working on, especially if you hit blockers or if work is taking longer than expected\n**Stop:**\n- **Making assumptions without validation** - Even if it feels like you understand the requirement, verify your interpretation when details are sparse\n**Keep:**\n- **Being curious about new technology like AI-assisted development** - Your enthusiasm for exploring new tools brings value to the team\n\n**Tom Anastasio:**\n- **Keep Doing:**\n   - **Keep leveraging your exceptional patience and clear communication style** when onboarding new team members or pairing with people who are learning new technical domains. This is a rare and highly valued mentorship quality.\n   - **Keep bringing your creative problem-solving skills** to technical challenges. Your ability to find effective solutions while maintaining a calm, friendly vibe is a great asset to the team environment.\n   - **Keep being a highly supportive and friendly presence.** Your positive approach makes challenging work accessible and enjoyable for others.\n- **Start Doing:**\n   - **Start seeking out opportunities to formally mentor or lead knowledge-sharing sessions** on topics where you naturally use those creative solutions. Your ability to explain complex topics simply should be used to teach the wider team.\n   - **Start actively promoting the solutions you develop.** Since you are adept at finding creative fixes, be more proactive about sharing these wins with the broader team to maximize their impact and showcase your technical depth.\n",
