### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Being local to the customer and having access to SIPR has been helpful to reduce the limiting factor of SIPR development as well as help get me up to speed on the project.
2. I have been able to learn a lot about the project from interacting with the customers in person, which has helped to onboard quickly and have a more thorough understanding of the account.
3. I drove development to add a feature that allows users to revert a report status when dismissing a report. This eliminated potentially incorrect information displaying to the user.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Cory is new on this team but has showcased his abilities to learn a new platform, persist through obscurity, and think critically. He commonly speaks up to point things out that don't make sense or to offer his perspective on ambiguous situations. He impressively built a multi-state income tax calculator in Warp Core as a way to learn the platform, completing it in a relatively short time.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- Giving feedback to teammates when necessary. I haven't received any from Cory, and I know I've caught myself leading pairing instead of passing the baton, or working on something that could be paired on without being in a Google Meet.
- Consider turning your webcam on from time to time. My webcam usage varies, and tends to be off more than it's on, but it allows "conversation" even while muted with facial expressions and body language. Your clothing, home decor, and random background items can spark the water cooler conversations that we usually miss out on since we're remote. I've personally like having video on for stand up and usually having it off the rest of the day.
Stop
- I've noticed Cory will pause or use filler words while putting his thoughts together. I also have to work on this - I've found keeping a GDoc journal of my activities each day has helped me organize my thoughts before the next day's stand up, and I can quickly and succinctly give my update. I also try to gather my thoughts when formulating an answer by saying "I got you, I'll take a minute to think about this" if I feel I need a longer pause. 
Keep doing
- Being a great development partner. You search documentation when I'm driving and running into trouble, you gained a great amount of Warp Core knowledge by building your pro dev projects, and you think about the bigger picture when we work through things.

**Comment**:
> Start increasing your curiosity about the objectives and key results (OKRs) for the software we are building. Your effectiveness will significantly increase when you are more aware of the "why" behind the problems we are addressing, leveraging your existing deep domain knowledge to contribute not just as an engineer, but as a subject matter expert (from the years you served). 




Keep demonstrating your initiative by pairing with teammates and diving into new work. Since you started, your consistent willingness to jump into tasks, whether to learn or to lead, has been noticeable and highly valuable. Please continue to engage with the work without hesitation.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Cory because he has demonstrated rapid growth, strong initiative, and a consistently positive impact on the team. Despite being new to the project, he ramped up quickly, stepped confidently into unfamiliar areas, and showed a willingness to ask questions and learn without ego. His professionalism, work ethic, and strong customer-facing presence has made him a reliable contributor. 




Cory has already proven that he elevates team performance and helps us deliver outcomes more consistently. With his continued growth in collaboration and feedback, he will only become more effective. He is exactly the kind of teammate who makes a team stronger, and I would welcome the chance to work with him again.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Speaking up more during pairing sessions**, especially with more experienced developers. Cory has expressed a desire to drive more, and proactively voicing this at the start of sessions will help him build confidence and gain the hands-on experience he’s seeking.
- **Providing more feedback to teammates.** Developing this skill will support a healthier feedback culture and open the door for more reciprocal input that will accelerate his growth as an engineer and teammate.




### **STOP**
- **Holding back when he wants to lead.** Cory occasionally hesitates to assert himself during collaborative sessions despite wanting more opportunities to drive. Reducing this hesitation will help him progress more quickly.




### **KEEP DOING**
- **Continuing to ramp up quickly and take initiative.** His willingness to learn, ask questions, and step outside his current knowledge area—such as taking on SIPR work—sets him up for long-term success.
- **Maintaining his strong work ethic and professionalism**, especially in customer-facing interactions on site.
- **Maintaining his steady, reliable presence on the project.** Cory has already become a valuable contributor, and his efforts have directly helped the team deliver outcomes more consistently.
