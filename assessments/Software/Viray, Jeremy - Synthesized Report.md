## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. Getting the Nimbus application into production as well as getting outcomes in production to meet our brand promise. We were the first app on the RAD platform to get into production. Working closely with the portfolio team we helped define processes and iterate on the CI/CD pipeline to get it to where it's at today. Additionally, we were able to get working software into the hands of the weather squadron that positively impacts their mission.
2. Getting the Nimbus application to be public facing. This was a huge win for our team, getting our application to be public facing meant more people can access weather information. This not only led to user outcomes but also made our stakeholders very happy, as getting this weather information out to as many people as possible is high on their list of priorities.
3. Working on Nimbus from the ground up was one of the most valuable professional experiences of my career. Seeing the product evolve from inception to its current state taught me a great deal about product and design which are areas I had little exposure to before. Collaborating with my fellow developers has fundamentally shaped the way I think about software development. I’ve learned not just best practices like test-driven development, but also how to write cleaner, more maintainable code, and break down problems effectively.




Additionally this growth continued to escalate as I joined the Bifrost team. The realm of platform and CICD before this team was a cosmic void for me. Knowing zero about platform and CICD to being able to confidently write pipeline jobs and understand the architecture of what's needed from kubernetes, to runners, to security requirements. I feel like the amount of learning I've done in this past year is monumental and its made me a much more confident developer. The experience and lessons I’ve gained will undoubtedly carry over into future engagements

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Bryce Nguonly:**
I think that one of your greatest strengths is having a good balance with AI. What I think that means is knowing when to use it, asking the right prompts at the level of understanding that you have, and being open with your pair on the whys behind your prompts. I've seen you level up really fast in terms of breadth and depth of knowledge by prompting, and you always keep note of what you've learned.

**Delaney Coveno:**
Jeremy is willing to pick up any task and will get the job done. He learns quickly and is easy to work with. He got comfortable in the Mission Manager platform really quickly and is a reliable problem solver. He approaches new challenges in a calm and steady fashion.

**Chris Johns:**
Jeremy consistently proves himself to be a diligent, highly effective engineer who excels at delivering complex CI/CD functionality, integrating security controls, and actively supporting team processes through clear documentation and collaboration. 
- Jeremy has been the driving force behind defining, building, and refining the core automation platform that dictates how applications are onboarded and deployed.
- Jeremy consistently takes on complex, ambiguous technical challenges and breaks them down, often uncovering fundamental issues or devising sophisticated solutions that unblock the team.

**Clark Pain:**
I have enjoyed my time working with Jeremy. He always has a positive attitude and is willing to take on whatever the team needs. He's a consistent performer that is making consistent progress on the growth curve.

**Dan Sanker:**
Jeremy is a great teammate and a pleasure to work with. He consistently delivers both value and insight to the stories he's working on. He has a fantastic, positive attitude and a clear drive for quality, which makes him a reliable and effective pairing partner. He is confident in his skills and, at the same time, clearly ready and willing to learn more, which is the exact combination you want in a strong SWE.

**Kenny Slater:**
I have seen when Jeremy is assigned as task, that task gets completed. I have not had the opportunity to work with Jeremy too much, but I am happy he is on our team.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser because he consistently demonstrate strong ownership and reliability. Even without working directly together, it’s clear from daily standups that he takes initiative, close out work efficiently, and actively looks for new ways to contribute. Jeremy's consistency and accountability make a noticeable impact on team momentum and delivery.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Jeremy has been really valuable on the Bifrost team. Although he's coming from the app dev background, he found solid footing on a platform project. He's worked on some of the ADRs the team is using to define to vision for the project, and his work is solid and comprehensive.  He's using the processes the team has in place to contribute to the overall architecture of the platform.  I'd like to see him take that next step (defining the questions that need to be asked) and start to drive the overall direction of the team.

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Bryce Nguonly:**
We are both learning this platform space together, but I think that you could try to be more in tune with what stories are coming down the pipeline and how they relate to an epic. Be more open to story generation time, so you can have a better understanding at bridging the gap between stories and how they affect user outcome. 
I think you are already really good at understanding your current track of work and its next steps down to the detail, and completing stories without inflating their scope. 




If you get lost in ATO discussion/strategy meetings, can always jump into 1:1s or breakouts with other disciples to help understand what actually was discussed to get a clearer picture of where Bifrost stands from a non-technical point of view. It would help bridge the gap between in the weeds stories and the requirements/outcomes those stories are trying to fulfill.

**Delaney Coveno:**
- Start: Sharing more thoughts/questions in architectural discussions and group settings. His perspective is valuable it would help team discussions to hear from him more frequently.
- Continue: Being a good listener and sharing responsibility while pairing. Continue leaving room for both conversation and deep thought/research. Continue approaching work in a calm manner.

**Chris Johns:**
Keep Doing:
- Keep taking the lead in designing and implementing the end-to-end CI/CD pipeline and deployment process.
- Keep championing the need for architectural clarity and shared team vision.
Start Doing:
- Start dedicating time to defining the technical promotion and release verification process.
- Start contributing to new strategic tracks outside of core CI/CD implementation.
Stop Doing:
- Stop restarting work on technical stories that peers believe are finished without immediate feedback.
- Stop personally engaging in technical troubleshooting when external teams are blocking core features.

**Clark Pain:**
Keep tackling challenges with curiosity and moving out of your comfort zone to expand your skillset. Keep bringing your positive attitude to everything you do, its infectious! Next year, I'd love to see you get involved in the higher level strategic plans and potentially do some customer-facing work to flex your consulting skills.

**Dan Sanker:**
Start:
- Start taking the lead on larger or more complex features. Your skills, attitude, and drive for quality show you're ready to start owning the technical design and execution of a major story from start to finish.
Stop:
- I don't have anything I'd recommend you stop. Your current approach is highly effective and a great asset to the team.
Keep:
- Keep that positive, collaborative attitude. It makes you a go-to person for pairing.  Keep bringing your insights to the stories. Your drive for quality is clear, and it raises the team's standard.

**Kenny Slater:**
Start: Having more input and jump in conversations more. Feel free to give your opinion on discussions and team related debates.
Stop:NA
Keep Doing: Working hard, I have seen the amount of tickets you are working/have worked so I know you are working hard.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
**Keep:** Maintaining that proactive, dependable approach to getting things done.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Start: Jumping into team conversations as much as possible whenever you have an idea, a concern, or an opportunity to optimize.  In a big team, you don't have to do this, but knocking ideas around with your teammates will make it a lot easier to make the jump when you end up on a smaller team and suddenly you're the anchor.  




Continue: Learning as much as you can about platform development, bringing your own experience, expertise, and good ideas to the table, and helping define how Bifrost will come together.
