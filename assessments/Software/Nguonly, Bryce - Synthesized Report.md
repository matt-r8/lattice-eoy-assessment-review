## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

Submitted first outcome in prod: 
On Nimbus I helped submit our first outcome in prod. There was a lot of challenges and learnings from that. Mostly coming back to the fact that we should always be working toward an outcome in prod. The stories we work on should have a clear path on how they relate to an outcome. Now on my second team at Rise8, I have a better understanding on the end to end process of what is required to put an outcome in prod. 




Leveraging AI:
My usage of generative code AI has skyrocketed this year alone. From maybe 5% to 85%+ of the time. Its helped me gain context on unknown topics or technologies without having to know the intricacies. I can focus on the more important aspects, such as building test or delivering quickly to gain faster iteration cycles. Using AI has helped me think at a higher level all the time, making sure the work I am doing is directly impacting users of my products/services. At the same time, I was able to jump right into platform work and make a contribution to the team without much technical background in the area. 




Closing down Nimbus:
Although Nimbus/SLD45 weather app did not continue, I learned how to leave our users in a safe place. What I mean is that our application will still provide its users value, despite not having active development/support. Even though theres not an active Rise8 team working on Nimbus, the project is in a state to picked up and immediately have tracks of work that would add more user value. It was a good learning experience, on knowing when/how to make decisions on certain features. And how not to leave production applications in an incomplete state.
