  "accomplishments": "My primary accomplishment was leading as a key driver on the MOSS team, which delivered 12 distinct outcomes in production from January to July. This contribution was a massive driver of Rise8's mission, accounting for nearly one-third (31.6%) of the entire company's 38 outcomes for the first half of the year. Our team was incredibly outcome focused, which culminated in Rise8 acknowledging MOSS as this year's Dream Team. This work had a direct and massive impact on Rise8\u2019s mission through supporting our brand promise to the warfighter. I was incredibly invested in this outcome-driven approach. This positively influenced my team's alignment towards our mission and to ensure we captured the full value of outcomes we had already achieved and planned to achieve.\n\n\n\n\nI served as a key contributor in building a high-stakes relationship with a USDS engineer who was evaluating vendor competencies. I went beyond a simple demo and acted as his primary coding pair partner, integrating him directly into our workflow, putting hands on keyboard. This bold, hands-on approach showcased Rise8's technical excellence and core collaborative values in real-time, well before any formal client commitment. The impact was significant: the engineer noted the \"stark contrast between Rise8 and other contractors,\" calling the experience \"so valuable\" and \"amazing\" and stating he had \"never heard of this happening anywhere in government.\" This action directly positioned Rise8 favorably against legacy vendors, proving our superiority for future government contracts.\n\n\n\n\nI demonstrated a \"Do What is Required\" mindset by proactively identifying and filling strategic gaps outside my core engineering responsibilities. When marketing voiced a need, I stepped in to photograph Prodacity, solving a resource gap and providing high-quality image assets that now support Rise8's company branding on social media. I also took a key leadership role in offsite planning, an effort that resulted in an overwhelmingly successful event, directly supporting the CEO's initiative to invest in riser relationships and strengthen our culture. Finally seeing a professional growth opportunity, I joined a Prod Patrol cohort to enrich my business acumen, which pays dividends in exposure to Rise8's philosophy on outcomes not only to myself, but also within teammates.",
  "enps_comments": "**Paul Nieto:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Justin because he has shown tremendous growth as an engineer, skill, and consistently demonstrates a willingness to learn. Having worked with Justin on two teams this year, MOSS and Tracer, I have seen his ability to adapt and deliver first-hand. On MOSS, Justin showed a great command of the codebase which was invaluable when I was onboarding; he helped answer my questions and explained the reasoning behind our processes. He was key to MOSS delivering outcomes (which we were working on to the last minute) and closing out the contract on a successful note. His efforts resulted MOSS achieving user outcomes in production, and he showed his ability as an engineer during that process. Justin has also done a great job embracing Bryon\u2019s AI Invite. He organized and led an AI Challenge for our team, which proved to be eye-opening and helped us understand the limitations and abilities of the tools at the time.\nBeyond his technical contributions, Justin is an excellent teammate. Having paired together regularly, he has proven to be extremely coachable and always engaged in discussion, while simultaneously offering great technical insights that show his aptitude for understanding both familiar and unfamiliar technologies. He engages in discussions with the team and is ready to face any task. He is consistently looking for ways to speed up processes, keeping up to date on the latest AI developments. His combination of technical ability, aptitude for learning, and collaborative nature makes him an asset to the team.\n\n**Michael Silverman:**\nJustin is a fantastic engineer to work with, bringing a consistent attitude of openness and a sincere willingness to learn. He is always ready to fill whatever role the team needs, preferring to get hands-on with problems to understand them deeply rather than staying on the sidelines.\n\n\n\n\nA major highlight this year has been his leadership in AI adoption. Justin has been one of our biggest adopters of AI coding tools, going so far as to design and execute an AI coding experiment for the Tracer team. This initiative didn't just help him; it helped the rest of the team understand how to better utilize these tools, directly improving our overall velocity and capability.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\nJustin is a strong engineer who shows incredible grit in the face of having to learn a new, complicated domain and codebase, as well as a solid growth mindset by always accepting a challenge to learn something new. He brings an impeccable attitude that raises the energy in the room while being mindful that everyone in the room is comfortable. Justin is laser-focused on getting Tracer across the first finish line and achieving those outcomes in prod that prove we've finally made an impact. Finally, Justin has been quite involved in a number of company-wide initiatives, and it's clear how wide of an impact his efforts have.\n\n**Alexandra Brierton:**\nI would rehire Justin. He brings a fun, positive energy to our team and contributes meaningfully to our culture. He consistently raises important points about outcomes in production\u2014something that has been difficult for our team to achieve but is a known top priority at Rise8. He\u2019s also incredibly empathetic and thoughtful; he notices things others might miss and genuinely cares about his teammates. Beyond engineering work, I paired with him throughout the planning of our summer company retreat where he showed extraordinary care and patience, especially in coordinating the swag vendor through dozens of revisions and detailed email exchanges. He went out of his way to make sure everything turned out right, and later even handled ordering, packaging, and shipping items for our small working group completely on his own time. That thoughtfulness and generosity says a lot about who he is and how much he cares about the people he works with. I appreciate how openly he communicates, how much he cares about Rise8\u2019s mission, and how willing he is to help the team.\n\n**Mary Pollin:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Justin. He is highly motivated and demonstrates key traits of a developing A Player. Specifically, Justin exhibits a strong Growth Mindset, showing he is always looking to improve to better support the team and mission. This commitment to continual learning is vital. Justin is not afraid to ask questions when he doesn't have the context for something. This proactive behavior prevents delays and ensures alignment, demonstrating he seeks to develop his abilities through hard work. Finally, Justin works hard to get results, showing commitment to delivering quality work and impact as a practitioner.\n\n**Dave Chapman:**\nI agree I would rehire Justin. He has adapted well since joining, effectively learning the codebase and wholeheartedly embracing AI to improve our development process. I was particularly impressed by how he stepped up to demonstrate the Control Import/Export feature to our CEO; he was professional, bold, and effective. While he tends to 'lay low' in broader team debates, he brings a no-nonsense candor to engineering discussions that contributes to our continuous improvement.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Paul Nieto:**\nStart: I would like to see Justin start engaging more in domain discussions. As he continues to get familiar with the Tracer domain and codebase, his input would be highly valued in these higher-level conversations.\n\n\n\n\nStop: There is nothing that comes to mind that Justin should stop doing; his growth and contributions this year have been excellent.\n\n\n\n\nKeep: Justin should keep working on getting familiar with the Tracer domain, just as he did with the MOSS domain. He should also continue developing his technical ability and embracing new technologies; his aptitude for learning unfamiliar tools and his collaborative approach to pairing are assets he should definitely maintain.\n\n**Michael Silverman:**\nStart: Justin should start helping Tracer focus on production outcomes. He comes from a team that excelled at generating measurable outcomes, and I want him to bring that mindset here. By advising and aligning us on those practices, he can play a key role in preparing Tracer for our next phase of outcome-driven development.\n\n\n\n\nStop: Justin should stop discounting his own abilities and contributions. There are times when he defers to others or suggests his opinion carries less weight due to 'lack of experience.' He needs to stop doing that. He is smart, capable, and makes valuable contributions. I want him to trust his instincts and speak with the authority he has earned.\n\n\n\n\nKeep: He should keep his openness to learn and his habit of seeking out growth opportunities. I really appreciate that he puts himself in a position to improve by volunteering for stories he lacks experience in and asking questions when he doesn't understand. That fearlessness is exactly how you grow quickly.\n\n**Alden Davidson:**\n- Keep having that growth mindset; you're always trying to learn your craft and better understand the codebase, and that combined with your openness with admitting when you don't know something has set you up for incredible growth.\n- Stop being worried that your opinions and perspective on product direction are less informed or valuable than others'; it's clear to me that you've come a long way in your grasp of the domain and codebase, and I want to make sure you're unafraid to give your insight when we're making decisions as a team. It's valuable to have, and will only make our team and product stronger!\n\n**Mary Pollin:**\nKeep maintaining a strong Growth Mindset and dedication to continual learning.\nYour eagerness to grow and ask clarifying questions is the foundation of being an A Player. Maintain this curiosity and dedication to achieving results. Continue to deliver high-quality code and drive features to Outcomes in Production. This commitment ensures the team consistently meets goals and delivers value to the customer.\n\n**Dave Chapman:**\n**Keep Doing:**\n- **Leaning into AI:** You have wholeheartedly adopted AI within our development process. Keep pushing the boundaries here and sharing those efficiencies with the team.\n- **Stepping up in High-Stakes Moments:** Your demo of the Control Import/Export feature to the CEO was excellent. You showed you can flip the switch to be professional and bold when it counts\u2014keep seeking those opportunities.\n- **Speaking your mind:** I value your direct, no-nonsense approach when asked questions.\n**Start Doing:**\n- **Act like an entrepreneur in your domain:** I want you to take 10-20% of your time to explore the \"art of the possible.\" Don't just wait for a ticket; research technical features our competitors have, find open-source tools we can leverage, and bring proactive proposals to the table.\n- **Bring prototypes, not just reports:** (Standard Block) When we do Spikes or exploration, I want to see more than just written analysis. Bring back working software, mockups, or a branch with a tool integrated.\n- **Deepening Domain Knowledge:** You are learning the code well, but I need you to start engaging more with the *compliance domain*. To be an A Player here, you need to understand the \"why\" behind the features, not just the \"how\" of the implementation.\n**Stop Doing:**\n- **Waiting for explicit direction to innovate:** (Standard Block) Stop relying solely on Product to define every improvement. Don't just execute what is assigned; challenge the status quo with tangible examples of how we can be better.\n- **Defaulting to \"Devil's Advocate\" without solutions:** While I value your candor, be careful that your \"no-nonsense\" attitude doesn't stop at just identifying problems. A Players bring solutions. Ensure your sarcasm or self-deprecation doesn't mask your actual contributions or lower the energy of the team in our internal \"safe space.\"\n",
