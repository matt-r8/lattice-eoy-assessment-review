  "accomplishments": "1. Getting the \"Certificate Health Monitor\" project into the Halkan release (Be Bold / Do What Works / Outcomes in Prod). I identified a strategic opportunity during a routine check-in with stakeholder Aaron Gonzales. I took the initiative to demo our work after only a few weeks, showing a prototype that already featured 80% of his desired functionality. This timely move, executed well ahead of schedule, got us into the \"Halkan\" release (EM&C PI 7), even though the initial cutoff had already passed. This result not only put outcomes in production a full cycle early, but Aaron\u2019s positive reception placed us on his \"gold star\" list and secured our next project assignments.\n\n\n\n\n2. Pragmatic engineering decisions (Do The Right Thing). During the development of our Narrowband Resource Request parsing logic, I successfully advocated for and implemented a database view strategy to handle the two distinct request types. Despite strong internal pressure to use a single-table approach, I leveraged my experience to demonstrate why views were the elegant and correct engineering choice. This decision prevented significant technical debt and ensured our data models remain maintainable as we continue development of the product.\n\n\n\n\n3. Building trust with external codebase owners (Always Be Kind). I have cultivated a critical relationship with the external engineering teams whose codebases we contribute to. By approaching them with professionalism and respect, rather than grandstanding, I have built a level of trust that allows our team to operate with several degrees of freedom. This \"quiet diplomacy\" has been essential in getting our code merged and ensuring our \"Outcomes in Prod\" continue to happen on (or ahead of) schedule.",
  "enps_comments": "**Shubham Goel:**\nChris has been a great teammate - kind, collaborative, and easy to work with. I  appreciate the support he provided in product acceptance testing and helping product strengthen testing clarity and rigor. He brings thoughtful ideas on how product and engineering can work more closely together, which has made a noticeable difference in team alignment.\n\n\n\n\nChris also brings a strong technical voice to Narrowband. His insights on feasibility, system behavior, and SAR-grounded implementation considerations have helped ensure we\u2019re building the right things in the right way. His feedback during the workflow editor demo was especially valuable - encouraging product to showcase the entire flow rather than just granular features helped elevate the quality and clarity of our presentation.\n\n\n\n\nOne thing I really admire about Chris is his deliberate, thoughtful approach to project implementation. He analyzes multiple risks when making decisions, provides sound reasoning, and ensures the team has a stable technical path forward. He is a strong engineer and a natural leader whose experience helps steer the team toward high-quality solutions. He also consistently looks out for team success making sure our backlog is prepped, groomed, and filled enough for development to stay unblocked.\n\n\n\n\nI\u2019d encourage Chris to lean even more into those leadership qualities. Whether that\u2019s giving a Lightning Talk, sharing technical insights with other engineers, or mentoring across the org, he has a lot of knowledge and positive influence to offer. He is valuable voice for the broader Rise8 engineering community. Overall, Chris is a reliable, thoughtful, and high-impact teammate who makes working together and productive.\n\n**Ben Adinata:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Chris. He is always thinking ahead and pushing for clarity, which helps the team navigate challenges smoothly. For example, during Pre-IPM, he questions features that might not be valuable yet, which helps us prioritize the work that actually matters. He also spots underlying system problems and ensures they get ticketed, which prevents bugs in the product later on.\n\n\n\n\nHis experience is a huge asset for the team. When I pair with him, he doesn't just code\u2014he actively mentors me, pointing out potential pitfalls and offering advice that has helped me improve my own skills. His focus on clear design prevents rework and saves us from having to constantly ask for clarification, which makes us all more productive.\n\n**Norman Sharpe:**\nChris is a **high-value addition to the team** who excels at problem solving, and communication.\n\n\n\n\nHe has a strong ability to synthesize complex information, specifically regarding long-term impacts and potential risks, and has saved the team lots of time with his insights. His ability to scaffold patterns that support future complexity is a major asset to our codebase.\n\n\n\n\nIn pairing sessions, he is communicative and transparent, explaining his thought process clearly and raising valid concerns in real-time. While his caution is excellent for quality control, and team relationships internally and within EM&C portfolio, it occasionally hinders momentum when risk identification isn't immediately paired with a constructive path forward. He is a strong advocate for team health and consistently supports collective decisions once made. Lastly, he has been a great source of feedback, and has approached conflict in a very healthy way, leading to a lot of trust being built across the team.\n\n**Drew Fugate:**\nChris combines a strong technical discipline with a high sense of ownership, multiplying his contributions to the team.\n\n\n\n\n- **Ownership & Value Focus:** They have demonstrated a ship outcomes mindset rather than a ship outputs mindset. I appreciate that they see stories all the way through to E2E and Dev environments to verify functionality, often going the extra mile to fix peripheral issues caused by other teams. Their participation in rituals is also crucial; they don't just accept requirements, they help shape them to ensure we are delivering measurable user value.\n- **XP Discipline:** In an age where AI can sometimes encourage isolation, Chris has maintained the discipline of true pair programming. They use pairing not just to write code, but to share knowledge and prevent silos.\n- **Technical Quality:** Their code is consistently well-tested, reliable, and maintainable, setting a standard for the rest of the team.\n\n**Seehyun Kim:**\nI would love to be on the same team with Chris again because he brings years of experience, strong analytical thinking, and the ability to articulate complex concepts clearly. His expertise in software development and deployment adds valuable perspective to the team, and he consistently elevates our discussions. I also admire his consulting skills and how effectively he approaches and frames even non-technical subjects. This is something I hope to continue learning from. I genuinely feel fortunate to work alongside someone with his depth of knowledge and insight.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Shubham Goel:**\n**Start:**\n\u2013 Sharing more of his technical leadership across Rise8 through a Lightning Talk, Loom videos, or consulting with other engineers.\n**Keep:**\n\u2013 Bringing thoughtful, risk-aware technical reasoning to Narrowband implementation.\n\u2013 Offering strong, constructive feedback like elevating the workflow editor demo to show the full experience.\n\u2013 Ensuring the backlog is healthy, organized, and ready for the next iteration.\n\u2013 Acting as a stabilizing technical leader who grounds decisions in SAR feasibility and sound engineering principles.\n\u2013 Continuing to help tighten product-engineering alignment; his instincts for collaboration are strong and very impactful.\n\n**Ben Adinata:**\n**Start:** I would love to see you start taking on the SWE anchor role when it's time to rotate. Your foresight and ability to spot system-level issues would be a huge asset in that position, and I think you would be great at it.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop:** If anything, I suggest you stop hesitating when you are confident in a decision. Your instincts are solid, and the team trusts your judgment, so don't be afraid to be bold and make the call.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep:** Please keep challenging our features in Pre-IPM and pushing for that high standard of design clarity. Your willingness to mentor and share your experience during pairing is invaluable.\n\n**Norman Sharpe:**\n**Keep Doing:**\n- Keep synthesizing the \"big picture\" constraints. Your foresight regarding long-term engineering impacts and identifying detrimental UX issues before we ship is a superpower.\n- Keep scaffolding patterns in our codebase (even if it's just mirroring Wideband sometimes). Implementing patterns early on that help the codebase handle growing complexity has saved the team significant technical debt compared to more independant workflows/implementations.\n- Keep providing real and raw feedback, even when it's uncomfortable.\n**Stop Doing:**\n- Stop identifying risks without proposing mitigations. Highlighting a problem without a potential solution slows momentum and can feel like blocking rather than helping.\n- Stop letting \"caution\" serve as a brake on alignment. Ensure that your desire to prevent issues doesn't come across as resistance to the team's outcomes; we need to move forward even when the path isn't 100% risk-free.\n**Start Doing:**\n- Start practicing \"solution-first\" feedback. When you spot a risk, frame it immediately with a path forward (e.g., \"This creates Risk X, so I propose we do Y to mitigate it and keep moving\").\n- Start calibrating your risk assessment for speed. Help the team distinguish between \"critical blockers\" and \"acceptable trade-offs\" so we can maintain velocity while staying safe.\n\n**Drew Fugate:**\n- **Keep:** Please keep your focus on mentorship during pairing. You have a natural ability to teach and share context while coding, which prevents knowledge silos and upskills the team. This is exactly the kind of \"force multiplier\" behavior we need from a Senior Engineer.\n- **Start:** I would like to see you start exercising your authority as a Senior Engineer to guide team dynamics more actively. If a meeting is going off the rails, or if one voice is dominating the room, I encourage you to step in and facilitate. You have the respect of the team; use that capital to keep our rituals focused and our discussions productive. You have the \"right of way\" to push back when things aren't right, please use it.\n- **Stop:** I recommend you stop feeling the need to concede just to resolve friction quickly. While being agreeable is a good trait, sometimes \"keeping the peace\" comes at the cost of the best technical or process decision. Don't shy away from holding your ground or managing friction directly; the team looks to you for that stability and direction.\n\n**Seehyun Kim:**\n- Keep challenging us and offering your honest feedback in a thoughtful and kind way. \n- Keep speaking up because your perspectives are extremely valuable to the team. \n- Keep connecting the bigger picture and guiding the team to focus on high-impact outcomes.\n",
