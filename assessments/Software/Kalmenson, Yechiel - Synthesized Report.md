**Edwin Karaya:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Yechiel. Although we had limited overlap this year due to his parental leave, every interaction I had with him was positive. He communicates clearly when discussing technical topics, contributes thoughtful insights, and is reliable and easy to collaborate with.
