<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. Delivering 15 user outcomes and 2 supporting outcomes on the teams I've been on this year (Kessel Run and MOSS). This directly impacts Rise8's mission by contributing a significant portion to the company's annual total and moving us closer to the BHAG of 50,000 outcomes in production by 2040.
2. Transition to senior role and rapidly taking on those responsibilities on MOSS with 90 days left on the contract so that our team finished strong and earned the Dream Team award. I took ownership of complex technical challenges, such as identifying a database optimization issue where a single table was growing out of control unnoticed (consuming nearly a gigabyte of memory) and led the research and communication on multi-tenancy with our platform providers. Furthermore, I prioritized mentorship by pairing with a new Skillbridger to ensure they could contribute effectively and managed vendor relationships with Duality to the plaudits of our stakeholders. These efforts ensured MOSS continued to deliver outcomes and satisfy stakeholders without blockers as the contract drew to a close, even delivering a crucial feature right at the end of the contract. This impacted Rise8's mission by producing outcomes and having happy customers.
3. Joining Tracer again and helping the team move forward on the FORGE contract. Tracer is an important part of FORGE and because of my former experience in the domain and on the team, I freed up other engineers to focus on critical FORGE-specific work like getting Tracer on FORGE and other important milestones. I also have contributed to discussions in the domain as we continue to identify the direction in which to take Tracer as requirements and direction shifts on FORGE. This impacts Rise8's mission by ensuring Tracer will be successful in it's part on FORGE which in turn contributes to the success of the entire FORGE platform and thereby impacting Rise8's mission of getting outcomes in production.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Alden Davidson:**
Paul is an absolutely stellar teammate and strong engineer. He is always thoughtful and calm, providing a measured response to challenging problems and circumstances - and in turn, this serves as a mediating influence for the rest of the team. Paul has a depth of experience, but doesn't let that block him from always being open and eager to learn new things and have his mind changed by the perspectives of others. His kind and trust-building demeanor elevates the overall dynamic and tenor of the team, and is always pleasant to work with.

**Michael Silverman:**
Paul is an excellent engineer whose combination of technical depth and cultural positivity makes him a force multiplier for the team. This year, he was the anchor for our delivery cadence; he successfully led the effort to maintain Tracer's feature velocity while the rest of the team was heads-down on deployment and environment challenges.




Paul constantly seeks to deepen his understanding of the domain, frequently initiating high-value discussions that ensure the team is solving the right problems, not just writing code. He also brings creativity to our process, notably leading the informative 'John Henry' AI experiment. His engineering expertise is an asset, but his attitude is what truly sets the tone for the team.

**Justin Reynolds:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Paul, with no reservations. He is a genuine value multiplier for the team. Paul is undoubtedly one of the catalysts that put the MOSS team on the ballot as the dream team. He quickly adapted to the needs of the company, onboarded rapidly, and immediately delivered outcomes. This definitely shows that he is willing to "Do What is Required" and has the "Grit" to see it through. He absolutely embodies the hypothesis-driven mentality outlined in XP Explained. He is always willing to mentor, coach, and roll up his sleeves to dig into complex problem-solving. Paul is incredibly empathetic, kind, and exhibits A Player behaviors better than other software engineers I have seen at his level.

**Alexandra Brierton:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Paul. He brings deep technical knowledge, strong curiosity, and a thoughtful, kind presence to every interaction. His communication is excellent—he consistently asks strong questions, contributes meaningfully in discussions, and provides clear asynchronous updates that help product and design stay unblocked. He’s reliable, collaborative, and incredibly easy to work with. He makes the team smarter, steadier, and more fun, and he embodies the values we want at Rise8.

**Mary Pollin:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Paul. Despite joining the team only a few months ago, he has quickly established himself as a high-impact contributor who aligns with the definition of an A Player. Paul consistently takes initiative to help as needed, often stepping into potential gaps without requiring explicit direction. This demonstrates the core A Player trait of high agency and Ownership Thinking. Rapid Learning and Strategic Questioning: He is very smart and quickly achieves competency in complex domains. His habit of asking good questions ensures he is aligned with the goals and vision of the organization and accelerates his personal growth. Finally, Paul works very hard for the team to drive value. This dedication ensures he is highly productive and contributes significantly to achieving Outcomes in Production.

**Dave Chapman:**
Paul is a Senior Engineer who never seems to have an 'off day.' I would enthusiastically rehire him for his stability, reliability, and incredible level of engagement. In just a few short months, he has established himself as a key voice in our debates, helping the team reach consensus through active listening and restating. He is kind and pleasant, yet he never shies away from expressing his opinion to ensure we are building the right thing. His presence guarantees that our technical discussions are productive and inclusive.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Alden Davidson:**
- Keep challenging and being open to being challenged; you do a great job presenting your opinions in team discussions but not holding onto them dogmatically particularly when presented by the evidence and perspective of others.
- Keep encouraging your teammates to do regular feedback; I get the sense that you do attempt to get some end-of-pairing feedback started sometimes, and that's a great habit that I think a lot of us struggle with. Keep leading by example, we all need it especially when it comes to feedback!

**Michael Silverman:**
Start: Paul should start leveraging his experience with MOSS to guide Tracer toward outcome-based delivery. While we aren't fully in an outcomes-environment yet, I want Paul to take a lead role in preparing our mindset for it. He has the background to help us define *why* we are building a feature, ensuring we are ready to measure value, not just velocity.




Keep: He should keep his incredibly kind and uplifting attitude. No matter the stress level or the complexity of the problem, Paul is always ready to lift up his teammates. It is not just *what* he says, but *how* he says it—he creates psychological safety that allows the team to take risks and learn. That energy is indispensable.

**Justin Reynolds:**
Absolutely keep the mentor attitude. This approach pays dividends in his investment in other Risers and is one of the unique qualities that makes him so valuable.




The only area I see for next-level growth would be to step into areas of increased influence and responsibility beyond his current assigned level. He has valuable contributions at SWE open office, but he could influence at a more organizational level in a lightning talk. Though I see him as an absolute A Player, this is what I see putting him on that next level & being a no brainer for promotion.

**Mary Pollin:**
Keep Doing - Continue taking high initiative and looking for ways to add value across the product, not just on assigned tickets.




Keep Doing - Keep asking great, challenging questions to ensure we're aligned on mission impact and to accelerate your learning.




Start Doing - Proactively identify a strategic technical problem not currently on the roadmap, analyze solutions, and drive a formal recommendation to solve it.

**Dave Chapman:**
**Keep Doing:**
- **Driving Consensus through Active Listening:** You are excellent at "debate" type discussions. Keep doing exactly what you are doing: re-articulating, restating, and asking clarifying questions. You are the reason we achieve a shared mental model between Product and Engineering.
- **Being Vocal and Engaged:** I value that you are always "on." When others are quiet or off-camera, you step up to fill the void with productive dialogue. Your engagement is a model for the rest of the team.
- **Bringing Positive Consistency:** You are stable, reliable, and pleasant to work with every single day. That consistent energy helps the team dynamic immensely.
**Start Doing:**
- **Act like an entrepreneur in your domain:** I want you to take 10-20% of your time to explore the "art of the possible." Don't just wait for a ticket; research technical features our competitors have, find open-source tools we can leverage, and bring proactive proposals to the table.
- **Bring prototypes, not just reports:** When we do Spikes or exploration, I want to see more than just written analysis. Bring back working software, mockups, or a branch with a tool integrated. Show us what is possible through demonstration rather than just description.
**Stop Doing:**
- **Waiting for explicit direction to innovate:** Stop relying solely on Product to define every improvement. You have the seniority and the history with Tracer—I want you to stop hesitating to share your own ideas. Don't just execute what is assigned; challenge the status quo with tangible examples of how we can be better.
