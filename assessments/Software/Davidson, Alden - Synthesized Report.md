## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. Applied a hypothesis-led evaluation of AI's impact on development. Building on my prior work to containerize the Tracer development environment - a key enabler for secure experimentation - I proactively researched and tested multiple AI frameworks (XPai, PRD, Spec Kit). I explored their application across diverse contexts, including our team's application (Tracer), platform engineering tasks, and greenfield development. To get actionable, data-driven insights, I helped organize a "John Henry" test comparing AI-assisted vs. manual development. This test provided the team with quantitative and qualitative data on development speed and code quality, allowing us to rapidly test our hypotheses and invest in what actually works.
2. Delivered critical platform capabilities well outside my primary role, which required a high degree of agency, resilience, and dedication to learning new skills. I took ownership of migrating our entire internal infrastructure to ECS, building the Terraform IaC to manage it - using AI to learn and accelerate this complex platform work. Concurrently, I led the deployment of Tracer to the FORGE dev cluster, building new Helm charts, coordinating with multiple other FORGE teams, and documenting the full onboarding process to share these learnings and accelerate future FORGE tenants.
3. Drove strategic alignment by saving significant engineering investment on a low-value data migration, demonstrating my focus on acting on mid-year feedback. I identified that a data migration task (EKS to ECS) would require a new front-end page and multiple APIs - a rabbit hole of significant effort. By weighing this investment against the low value of the data, I led the decision to do only what was essential and de-prioritize the work, saving the team weeks of development. This allowed us to focus on mission-critical outcomes and demonstrates my commitment to continuous learning and personal growth.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Michael Silverman:**
Alden is a fantastic engineer to work with and has been a critical part of the Tracer team since he joined. He combines strong engineering skills with an even greater determination to learn and improve. Alden is always diving into problems, learning everything he can until he gets to the heart of the issue.
A standout moment this year was when our EKS cluster became unstable; Alden spearheaded the effort to transfer our infrastructure to ECS. He rapidly upskilled on Helm charts, Terraform, and ECS orchestration until we were not just ready to deploy, but in a position to 'lift and shift' Tracer to other environments effortlessly. He is a constant participant in domain-level discussions, providing meaningful insights into Tracer's direction. He has already taken on senior-level responsibilities, and I look forward to seeing him formalize that role in the coming year.

**Paul Nieto:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Alden because he consistently demonstrates skill and tenacity, combining technical excellence with focus and diligence. He does the hard work even when it is outside of his immediate expertise, regardless of the scope. He took ownership of fixing Tracer's infrastructure and, alongside Michael, he successfully moved Tracer from EKS to ECS, debugged critical load balancer issues, and deployed Tracer to the FORGE platform. Despite not being a platform engineer, he utilized AI to navigate these challenges with little to no external help, demonstrating a drive and determination that serves as an example to the entire team. Alden has embraced the AI Initiative by effectively using AI on our team in other areas as well, proactively setting up our dev container and integrating tools like the AWS CLI to ensure technical hurdles do not block his completion of goals.
He technical ability is matched with clear communication; he actively participates in meetings to assist product and design with valuable insight and domain knowledge. He is an extremely quick learner who constantly seeks to improve (he is working on getting a CKA certification) even in areas he is not familiar with. Alden is always focused, never complacent, and has a deep understanding of our domain and software design choices. He is a reliable, engaged pair and teammate who communicates clearly with product and design, consistently demonstrating expertise and behavior that befit a senior engineer. Alden is an example to myself and other engineers and is a key asset to this team.

**Justin Reynolds:**
Alden is an incredible software engineer who is punching far above his weight class. He demonstrates exceptional grit and is always willing to dig into the weeds to find the correct solution. He never shortcuts pull requests, holding a very high standard for code quality. He'll often expose lessons learned and maintain application consistency, referencing pre-existing conventions I might have missed.




He balances this technical rigor with the human aspect of feedback, embodying the value of Always Be Kind. He "shreds" work while still acknowledging the human element, often approaching it with, "If I'm missing something, let's talk about it," which fosters an inclusive team environment.




A perfect example of his Growth Mindset and Boldness was his work on platform requirements. He had the foresight to voice this need to the company. When his request for dedicated platform support went unsupported, he (quite like Thanos) said, "Fine, I'll do it myself." He didn't have a negative attitude; he saw it as an opportunity to learn a new discipline of software engineering while being paid to do it, rather than being salty about the lack of support. He's ready for a higher level of position and influence.

**Alexandra Brierton:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Alden. He is one of the most collaborative, kind, and reliable engineers I’ve worked with, and he consistently brings thoughtfulness and a positive attitude into every interaction. He has a strong bias for action, communicates openly, and is never afraid to ask the hard or important questions that move our work forward. I also really appreciate how adaptable he is and how willing he is to dive into complex research problems with curiosity and persistence. He makes the team better, and he embodies the culture we want at Rise8.

**Mary Pollin:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Alden without hesitation. He is a high-performing developer who is easily in the top tier of his profession and is one of the employees every organization covets. He consistently demonstrates Ownership Thinking by dedicating significant technical effort to the necessary, often challenging, platform-side work. This willingness to Do What is Required to create outcomes and impact is a key indicator of his commitment to the mission. Furthermore, his deep domain knowledge and understanding of the overall vision for Tracer enable him to proactively challenge assumptions and ask crucial questions, ensuring the team stays aligned and focused on the right strategic track. Alden's reliable delivery and commitment to the health of the product mean he routinely meets or beats goals and quantifies his value to the organization.

**Dave Chapman:**
Alden is the backbone of our daily operations and I would absolutely rehire him. He consistently 'Does What is Required,' enthusiastically picking up administrative tasks and 'glue work' that others might ignore. He is organized, reliable, and transparent, setting the standard for professional presence on the team. Crucially, Alden most often acts as the liaison between Product and Engineering. He doesn't just build; he critiques and improves our direction by applying critical thinking to our ROI and value delivery. He is a solid, consistent performer who makes everyone around him better.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Michael Silverman:**
Start: Alden should start operating in a Senior role regarding Tracer’s architecture. I want to see him move from implementing features to independently analyzing, researching, and driving architectural improvements. He has the knowledge; now he needs to lead the strategy 'under his own power' rather than waiting for direction.




Stop: Alden should stop letting his deep dives impact his prioritization. Sometimes he gets 'lost in the sauce' of a specific problem. He needs to build the habit of stepping back, taking stock of the time invested, and recognizing when a solution is 'good enough' to ship so he doesn't block his own velocity.




Keep: He should keep his drive to learn and understand the 'why' behind everything. Alden doesn’t just want to patch a problem; he wants to dissect it. While this sometimes conflicts with his need to prioritize (see 'Stop'), it is an excellent quality that separates good engineers from great ones. I want him to keep that curiosity, just channel it more strategically.

**Paul Nieto:**
Start: There isn't anything that comes to mind that he should start in particular; Alden has demonstrated expertise and skill in all important areas.




Stop: There isn't anything that comes to mind that he should stop doing. He is consistently on time, focused, and ready to work on issues, never showing complacency in his tasks.




Keep: Alden should keep doing everything that he's currently doing as he is doing a great job in all areas. I would simply encourage him to continue his current trajectory of seeking improvements to his own skills, such as his work towards the CKA certification, and continue being an model engineer to the team.

**Justin Reynolds:**
I recommend Alden keep holding his high standards and digging into the nitty-gritty of questions and spikes. He balances the interpersonal and professional aspects of teamwork incredibly well.




I would like to see him start exerting more organizational influence across other teams. He has a lot to share at a higher level, and this would be commensurate with the promotion he's ready for.




I honestly wish I had higher critiques, but I don't have any "stop" recommendations. I can't advise him beyond maintaining the high level of standards he already brings.

**Mary Pollin:**
Keep Doing - Continue to apply your deep domain knowledge and technical skill to drive the critical platform-side health of Tracer.
Keep Doing - Keep challenging assumptions and asking the tough questions to ensure we remain strategically aligned and focused on the right mission impact.

**Dave Chapman:**
**Keep Doing:**
- **Being the "Team Glue" & Leader:** You consistently step up to handle the essential tasks that fall through the cracks—from team admin to knowledge management. This "Do What Is Required" attitude sets the standard for the team.
- **Bridging Product & Engineering:** You are invaluable as a liaison. Keep facilitating communication, bringing a product-mindset to technical discussions, and helping us evaluate ROI/Value, not just feasibility.
- **Culture of Mentorship:** Keep openly pairing with the team, especially the newer members. Your willingness to share knowledge and your consistent positive attitude are critical to our team's health.
- **Improving Development Processes:** Keep identifying friction in our dev process and smoothing it out.
**Start Doing:**
- **Act like an entrepreneur in your domain:** I want you to take 10-20% of your time to explore the "art of the possible." Don't just wait for a ticket; research technical features our competitors have, find open-source tools we can leverage, and bring proactive proposals to the table.
- **Bring prototypes, not just reports:** When we do Spikes or exploration, I want to see more than just written analysis. Bring back working software, mockups, or a branch with a tool integrated. Show us what is possible through demonstration rather than just description.
**Stop Doing:**
- **Waiting for explicit direction to innovate:** Stop relying solely on Product to define every improvement. You have the T-shaped skills to see the whole picture—I want you to stop hesitating to share your own ideas. Don't just execute what is assigned; challenge the status quo with tangible examples of how we can be better.
