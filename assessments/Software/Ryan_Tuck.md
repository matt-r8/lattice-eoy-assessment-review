Stop - using default prompts, and really start honing mine to get the most out of the AI systems I'm working with, specifically around dialing the temperature down to an appropriate level for greater determinism when needed (desired most of the time!) and dialing in the right balance of hands-off agentic flow with an appropriate amount of expert human review on things




Keep Doing - Staying fully abreast of the latest and greatest developments in the world of AI-assisted coding

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Pioneered User-Friendly Remote Development Environments at Rise8 - Leading the charge on and and working through kinks with GitHub Codespaces on R&D enabled a nonzero number of product owners with no intimate familiarity with git to leverage Claude Code in an easy-to-use and secure environment. If you've ever tried to have to explain git AND get someone outside of engineering to download the right stuff etc to get it all working, you may recognize how actually impactful this work was to the vision of getting all product people to become fluent with AI coding. I look forward to helping standardize remote development environments when we transition to GitLab also to avoid any of the silly headaches engineers might otherwise have to worry about with respect to developing and executing code on the same physical hardware that they need for using Slack and Chrome. 
2. First Full-stack AI-produced Project Bid at Rise8 - I produced the very first functioning proof-of-concept full-stack app submission for a VA project bid with a hilariously tight turnaround time from a one-shot prompt with Claude Code. The only time a project bid was sent over to the R&D team during my tenure there was one where we had less than a week to create a full-stack app and produce a 10-page writeup etc - something that five years ago would have been completely impractical to turn around without a real justification for the last-minute nature of the task. I didn't have access to the company decision-makers who thought this was a reasonable thing to take on or any context on how often these sorts of rapid-fire last-minute bids come across our desk, but I knew enough about AI coding and am elite enough to identify where Claude fails miserably and where it's super-helpful to nearly-perfectly shoot the gap of getting something produced and within spec within the requested turnaround time. A further iteration on the frontend with Jonathan Van Dalen allowed us to really push Claude to hone the design right where it needed to be. I have no idea whether the bid was accepted or what ultimately ended up happening with it, and so therefore it is in hindsight indistinguishable from a mere test, but I demonstrated to myself that I'm easily top 0.01% of engineers in the world who understand vibe coding and can wield these crazy powerful AI tools and that experience alone was worth it to me :)
3. Helped Secure AI Devcontainer - Security being the top priority that it always is and especially in a world where AI systems are not guaranteed to avoid scheming against their users, it was imperative to set up regular vulnerability scans of the container we were using and wire up GitHub Actions to rebuild and publish an updated container upon discovery of a CVE and the relevant patch in the tools we use (claude, goose, etc). I was able to put my familiarity with GitHub, actions, etc and my fundamental AI doomer outlook to productive use in these efforts to put security top of mind as part of our development here at Rise8.

**Comment**:
> I did not have the opportunity to work directly with Ryan other than for a few hours on a VA proposal task, and we worked mostly async and on disparate pieces, so I don't feel able to give answers to survey questions.




I can say that he jumped on the task we were asked to do, and although the effort was not a successful one, he was working hard on it for the short time frame we had. My personal experience working with him to explore AI and pair on design + AI was positive, but it was a chaotic task and time frame (something like 48 hours), communication was difficult across the whole team during that window, and there was a hand off to another developer. As such, I recall that there were some difficulties with the delivered code vs. the VA requirements, and some need for rework and a re-review of the requirements from the VA, which resulted in no time left by the deadline for design review/implementation.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Again, I don't have much context on Ryan. Given the short experience we had, I would suggest "slowing down to speed up" - pointing out potential feasibility problems and discussing with team/PM so that we can know and address mismatches with requirements as they occur.

**Comment**:
> During our time working together on the R&D team, I found it challenging to maintain visibility into your work and ensure alignment. In our XP environment, we rely heavily on frequent communication and rapid feedback loops. I needed to see more frequent pull requests, proactive check-ins when assumptions needed validation (especially on underspecified stories), and regular updates on progress. 




There were several instances where work took longer than expected without visible progress or communication about blockers, and times when deliverables didn't match expectations because assumptions weren't validated upfront. While I appreciate your curiosity about new technologies like AI-assisted development, succeeding in this type of environment requires much more frequent communication and collaboration than I observed during our time together.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
- **Submitting frequent, small PRs** - In XP environments, aim for daily or every 1-2 days rather than large PRs after extended periods
- **Proactively validating assumptions before starting work** - When stories are underspecified (e.g., one sentence), schedule a quick sync before beginning implementation to ensure alignment
- **Providing regular progress updates** - Use standups, Slack, or quick check-ins to communicate what you're working on, especially if you hit blockers or if work is taking longer than expected
**Stop:**
- **Making assumptions without validation** - Even if it feels like you understand the requirement, verify your interpretation when details are sparse
**Keep:**
- **Being curious about new technology like AI-assisted development** - Your enthusiasm for exploring new tools brings value to the team
