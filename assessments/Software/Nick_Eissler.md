**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I strongly agree that I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on the team.
This year, I consistently delivered high-impact technical work while staying outcome-focused, collaborative, and adaptable through multiple shifts in scope and technology. I took ownership of complex problems, such as refactoring Blitzar’s core schema and leading much of the backend implementation for our reporting feature, and helped drive both efforts to production under tight timelines. I also ramped quickly on the Kahless system and Angular, contributing meaningful fixes and improvements despite being in an unfamiliar codebase.
Beyond technical execution, I have made an effort to work more closely with product and stakeholders to clarify requirements, shape solutions that balanced user needs with engineering constraints, and participate more in cross-team collaboration.
Overall, I believe I demonstrated strong ownership, adaptability, and the ability to learn fast and deliver outcomes, qualities that align with Rise8’s mission that I will continue to build on next year.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
Start taking a bigger role in outcome planning and owning problems end to end. I could stand to improve on shaping our hypotheses and anchoring our decisions in measurable outcomes. I am also looking to keep building a deeper knowledge in cloud, orchestration, and networking to broaden my technical leadership.




**Stop:**
Stop hesitating when I don’t feel I have the “perfect” answer yet. Leaning further into “Be Less Certain” and shipping earlier experiments will help me validate assumptions faster.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Refactoring Blitzar's Main Schema




I led the effort to refactor Blitzar's resource request schema, a core schema in our application with many dependent types and DTOs, to support an alternate version of our form.  This included determining the solution, in this case using a discriminated union in our Zod schemas on the frontend and single table inheritance in our MySQL database, in order to maintain a singular schema (adding new schemas was something we wanted to avoid) while being able to support multiple form versions.  I justified this approach and the timeline with stakeholders as well, and we were able to complete the necessary overhauls and implement the new form version in around a week, delivering a key feature in production that provided value to the users.




2. EM&C/Kahless Work




The team and I were able to transition to the Kahless system after rolling off Blitzar very quickly and added immediate value to the application.  This included exploring existing micro-services implemented as well as ramping up to their UI repo written in Angular, a framework I have not used before.  I was able to pick up on Angular and the patterns established in the repo quickly, implementing UI fixes and updates that have since been merged, providing value to the system in a short time.  I also helped lead a proof of concept (still WIP) for a micro-service within the Kahless system dedicated to allowing other services to use the SMTP relay set up in Botany Bay (and eventually the one in KM).  The SMPT service is what we identified as the most potential for outcomes during our stop-gap work, and the goal is to expand its usage out to other services within Kahless when the proof of concept is complete, adding a lot of value to the system.




3. Reporting Feature




I took a main role in developing the backend logic for our reporting feature, something we were able to deliver under a tight deadline prior to rolling off from Blitzar.  This feature took in a collection of filters from the frontend, and returned an excel file of resource requests matching the requested filters, as well as additional derived fields calculated from the request (like how many days it was in each stage).  I coordinated with our product team as well as users/stakeholders to define the behavior of the feature, and we were able to deliver a working solution prior to stopping work.  This was an existing feature in JIST, the app we aimed to replace, but generating accurate and useful reports could take hours.  Our implementation shortened the time to seconds, and we included behavior to give the user confidence in the data they were receiving prior to generating the report.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I'd enthusiastically rehire Nick because he's a reliable, steady force who consistently crushes his core engineering work while stepping up in areas that directly impact our team's visibility and product direction. He brings fantastic flexibility and a customer-first mindset that goes well beyond his current level.




Nick handled the deep dive into unfamiliar tech like SMTP services head-on, showing the kind of growth and flexibility we need. This makes him an incredibly valuable and dependable asset in any project.




He absolutely knocked it out of the park with the company-wide Blitzar demo. The positive feedback we got, especially from Customer Success, shows his ability to be a compelling external voice for the team—a huge win for raising our profile.




His willingness to routinely volunteer for user discovery calls is key. He brings a valuable perspective that translates customer pain and product vision back to the technical work, which is exactly what a high-performing engineer should do.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep connecting with the customer. His consistent volunteering for user discovery calls is a major strength. He should continue to lead these interactions and use his strong communication skills to represent our team externally.




Start formalizing his technical foresight. The mid-year review noted that he could improve on identifying and flagging technical debt. Nick should start dedicating a small amount of time each sprint to review code and actively flag potential future risks or process bottlenecks, and then raise these risks directly to the team or the product manager.




Stop undervaluing his external contributions. His demo success and comfort in user calls show he has executive presence. He should not for permission to take the lead on team presentations or internal communications and instead proactively schedule or offer to run them himself.

**Comment**:
> I would gladly rehire Nick. Throughout our pairing sessions, he demonstrated strong ownership, clarity of thought, and a clear outcome oriented mindset. During my onboarding, he took the time to explain context and walk through his reasoning instead of just giving quick answers, which helped me get up to speed faster and accelerated my ability to contribute. When requirements were unclear, he was one of the first to push for clarity and make sure the team was aligned on what needed to be done.




Nick operates at a high level, doesn’t wait to be told what to do, and consistently contributes quality work at speed. He assumed responsibility for core areas of Blitzar and became a dependable source of truth for metrics, environments, and overall implementation details. His communication style is clear, concise, and easy to digest even when discussing complex technical topics. 




Most importantly, Nick consistently aligns with the A Player agreement. He challenges assumptions, supports his teammates, keeps the mission at the forefront, and delivers value without adding unnecessary complexity. I believe his presence raises the bar for the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I would like to see Nick share more of his technical thinking across Rise8. He has strong patterns and solutions that would benefit other engineers, and communicating them more widely could increase his impact. This could be through short lightning talks, documenting his thought process, or walking through architecture decisions during team sessions.




At times, he takes on a lot of responsibility and moves fast, which is a strength. But there are moments where bringing others into the process earlier could grow the team’s overall capability.




Nick should continue sharing context and explaining his reasoning the way he does. It helped me onboard quickly and makes complex topics easier to understand. His PR feedback consistently improves code quality across the team, and I’d like him to keep that level of attention. He should also continue taking initiative when requirements are unclear and structuring his ideas clearly in scratch files.
