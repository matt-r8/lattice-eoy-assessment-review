<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Becca James:**
Lambo is the epitome of a trustworthy teammate. I feel like I can rely upon him to not only do the job that needs to get done, but he knows when to pull on the right resources and include others. He has a skill in balancing independent action with collaborative decision making.




He has greatly improved practices and delivery cadence for the CFC teams over the past few months through hands-on coaching, technical leadership, and emphasizing documentation. He is an indispensable member of the team.




Most noteworthy, he is an excellent coach and has created strengthened relationships between portfolio and product teams. He has phenomenal feedback skills that allow him to be an effective leader and coach by providing guidance, suggestion, and correction (to both Risers and customers) kindly.

**Danny Benson:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Lambo because he is an exceptionally talented and highly proficient engineer whose technical skill and leadership have consistently elevated the teams he works with. Despite being placed on a contract with significant challenges, he quickly adapted, demonstrating remarkable aptitude for learning new technologies and a relentless commitment to the mission.




Lambo has been instrumental in turning around a complex project, navigating numerous hurdles, and increasing delivery to production. His mentorship, guidance, and creation of documentation for best practices and standard operating procedures have strengthened the product team and supported portfolio-level success. He also took initiative to secure access to classified environments and led critical engineering conversations with stakeholders. Lambo combines technical excellence, strategic impact, and an approachable yet authoritative demeanor, making him an invaluable asset. I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again without hesitation.

**Evan Mladinov:**
“In an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year”

**Abel A A Hernandez:**
Lambo hit the ground running on a team that had a lot of baggage and also on a new domain (Palantir/Warpcore) within a few weeks he had earn the trust and respect from the customer and our team.

**Sagar Akre:**
I would enthusiastically rehire David because he has been an outstanding presence on the team. He listens closely to engineers’ concerns, never makes assumptions, and consistently invites them into decision-making conversations in a way that feels collaborative, respectful, and effective.




This approach has built strong trust across the engineering team, as well as with PM and design. Everyone genuinely enjoys working with him, and his leadership style elevates the entire team. I do not have any major notes for improvement; he has been a consistently positive and valuable contributor.

**Mases Krikorian:**
In an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year

**Roshni Bhanderi:**
Lambo brings structure and leadership to the team. He has helped define and document key engineering practices, including production readiness steps and decision records, which have improved team alignment and clarity. I also appreciate that he shares his perspective while actively asking for input from others. He is open to feedback and encourages collaboration rather than making decisions unilaterally, which supports a healthy and inclusive team environment.

**KEEP:**

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Becca James:**
Continue: Leading the engineering team and using your experience to inform practices to grow. There's no one better to make those decisions.
Start: Sharing what you *want* to work on. The past months have been spent focused on turning the ship for OSIT's delivery -- what's the next big rock that you want to tackle?

**Evan Mladinov:**
“In an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year”

**Abel A A Hernandez:**
**Start** proactively identifying the best opportunities and methods for involving the Product Manager in early technical and feasibility strategic planning. With two Product Managers, a highly involved Product Designer with S-WC access, and an anxious customer, establishing clear boundaries on what to share externally versus what remains an internal early idea is crucial to prevent miscommunication and manage expectations effectively.




**Keep** being approachable, firm, and willing to teach. You have a unique ability to slow down and adjust your tone and technical complexity based on the audience, which is incredibly valuable for our team. Please continue making time to sync with non-engineer team members and encouraging our involvement in understanding both the current and ideal path to production, especially given the specific challenges related to Palantir/Warpcore.

**Sagar Akre:**
no notes

**Mases Krikorian:**

**Roshni Bhanderi:**
**Keep**: Encouraging strong engineering practices, documenting important processes, and creating space for others to contribute. Lambo's thoughtful and open approach to collaboration makes a positive difference on the team.
**Start**: Spending time coaching and developing engineers on the team. There are many devs who could benefit from Lambo's mentorship.
