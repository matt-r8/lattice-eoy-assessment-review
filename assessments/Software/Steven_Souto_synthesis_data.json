  "accomplishments": "We successfully handed off a user-adopted and highly available web and mobile application to SLD45 that continues to be used today with not a single reported outage since February of this year. I am very proud of the codebase we delivered and the way we set the platform team taking over the project up for success. Rise8 made a clear impression on SLD45 that we are a capable force for delivering outcomes at a speed unlike any other in the government sector. I also believe I left a tremendous impression of two our junior developers on the team as to what it means to be an engineering leader who keeps quality of engineering output and focus of mission at top of mind.\n\n\n\n\nI facilitated almost all of the pipeline design discussion for the Bifrost team. The feedback I got personally from those meetings and mentions in retro showed that they were very effective at creating a clear picture of our vision and detailed enough to directly create many tracks of work in the backlog. I spent a lot of time becoming a fast expert on what and effective SecRel pipeline design looks like, drawing on my experience as a client on multiple pipelines. I even facilitated a discussion on an infrastructure pipeline, which I had no prior experience with since joining the team. I believe these discussion were able to more completely align our engineering effort on a vision and even allowed our security experts on the team to more clearly communicate our technical intentions to stakeholders. \n\n\n\n\nFinally, and maybe this isn't an accomplishment but rather a result of these accomplishments, it was shared to me that our \"unicorn\" anchor on Bifrost recommended me for anchor of the product team when he leaves. I learned a tremendous amount from Graham, not just technically but also as a communicator, and it felt amazing to be hear that. I strive to have the same level of intuition and confidence that Graham showed.",
  "enps_comments": "**Jeremy Viray:**\nSteven is a foundational part of our team\u2019s success. I\u2019d describe him less as an engineer and more as a world-class problem solver. He approaches any challenge, technical, organizational, or product-related, with the same level of clarity and structured thinking. His ability to identify root causes, evaluate options, and steer the team toward the right path makes him invaluable. If there\u2019s a complex issue to unravel, Steven is the person you want leading the charge.\n\n**Bryce Nguonly:**\nYou are very driven and mission focused. Every action you take is because it relates to a outcome that we want to achieve. Pairing with you always feels like we are working on a higher level issue on what our story is trying to achieve, not just the engineering effort that the story dictates. You have a great sense one when people are not aligned, and you work on mediating those differences.\n\n**Dan Sanker:**\nI am consistently impressed by the depth of his technical understanding of our tools and services. More importantly, I value his willingness to have strong, well-reasoned opinions on *how* and *why* we should build things. That strategic mindset is critical to our success. I always look forward to opportunities to work and pair with him, both on this project and in the future.\n\n**Chris Johns:**\nSteven is a foundational engineer whose work is essential for realizing the project's core mission of automated, repeatable security pipelines. He combines exceptional technical skill in CI/CD and infrastructure-as-code with a sharp, proactive focus on architectural clarity and process maturity. Steven consistently delivers complex, foundational infrastructure required for multi-tenant deployments and compliance automation. He successfully collaborated on finishing the GitLab registry work and was able to migrate Grafana to pull its Helm chart from the new GitLab registry. Steven consistently takes time to pair up with all team members; providing much needed cross training and knowledge sharing.\n\n**Jennifer Van Hove:**\nOver this year, I think Steven's facilitation skills and leadership capabilities have grown considerably.  He's shifted from arguing a point to guiding a conversation.  Working in the context of a fairly experienced team, he holds his own in the conversation while helping to elicit contributions from other senior engineers.  Facilitating architecture conversations and setting the standard for collaboration on the team has really helped clarify goals and unify the team on a tactical level.  On the technical side, as an app dev, he jumped onto a platform team and has been a solid contributor since the beginning.\n\n**Delaney Coveno:**\nSteven has taken a central role on the team - he has a great understanding of our architecture and reasoning behind it, and he nimbly keeps track of all the different tracks of work. He is comfortable interfacing with external parties on technical matters and has done a good job doing that. Steven is skilled at understanding technical documentation and finding precise answers in it while problem solving. He thoughtfully contributes to team ceremonies and practices. He often leads technical conversations.\n\n**Clark Pain:**\nSteven is great to work with. He has very high standards and pushes the team to apply rigor wherever practicable. He brings an incredible amount of skill to the team and has been crucial to helping steer the team towards success. I would absolutely love to work with Steven in the future given the chance.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Jeremy Viray:**\nKeep leading the charge on important topics, it goes without saying but your voice and opinion is held to a high regard on the team. Additionally, you\u2019re great at breaking problems into digestible parts, and I really appreciate how you bring other engineers into the process early; often having small impromptu conversations or think sessions. Would love to do this more often. It gives all of us a chance to grow as problem solvers before the bigger team conversations.\n\n**Bryce Nguonly:**\nContinue to champion larger group engineering discussions. You always make great gameplans for how our discussions should go, and are very focused on what outcomes we want out of them. \nYou have a great ability to forecast what engineering tracks of work need to be completed next. I think your role working along side product to create epics and break those down into digestible stories has been super impactful for the team. \nAt the same note, sometimes when working on smaller efforts, you can blow up the scope of a particular story. I think its because of how rapidly the infrastructure we were working on was changing. If the scope of the story feels like its expanding, take a step back and think about if the spirit of the story is still being captured by the original story. If it is, then maybe lets just finish the original and add another filler to the backlog to account for the future work, if its not, lets capture the change we want to make in the story and reevaluate where were are.\n\n**Chris Johns:**\nKeep Doing:\n- Keep advocating for critical team process maturity and architectural consensus.\n- Keep tackling ambiguous design and implementation challenges\nStart Doing:\n- Start defining and automating the promotion and governance workflow**** \n- Start driving the full integration and maintenance of Bifrost's internal tooling.\nStop Doing:\n- Stop engaging in extensive manual troubleshooting for externally managed services.\n\n**Jennifer Van Hove:**\nStart: Jumping into conversations with partners and stakeholders when needed. Take those leadership skills out for a spin!\n\n\n\n\nStart: Leaning on your ability to figure things out via facilitation, asking questions, research, etc. to build comfort with ambiguity.  I truly appreciate your ability to spec things out, but also . . . accepting some ambiguity early on and trusting your ability to figure things out will give everyone a chance to lock in some details along the way.  If you optimize for detailed architecture, you get more unity but it takes more time, and you may not stick to the plan anyway . . . but it's always a balance.  You can figure out how/when to optimize the plan or optimize for speed/empowerment.  But this comment is more about building comfort with either option so that you can always make a choice.  \n\n\n\n\nContinue: Facilitating team conversations effectively;  pressing the team for clarity when they are inclined to do hand waving; leveling up the team as they get closer to production and start focusing on outcomes.\n\n**Delaney Coveno:**\n- Start: Bringing along at least a pair to architectural/story writing meetings to make sure we are sharing that responsibility. Steven has taken a lot of this on himself which is awesome but we should be sure to share the load as a team.\n- Stop: Steven can come across as impatient - slowing down for a moment to make sure you\u2019re on the same page as the team or as your pair will go a long way in accelerating our pace in the longer run.\n- Continue: Being a leader on the team and being an incredible technical problem solver. Sharing his opinions and thoughtfully engaging with our architecture and value stream. Actively shaping our team practices/ceremonies as well as team priorities and architecture.\n\n**Clark Pain:**\nKeep leading the development of the team's strategy and collaborating with kindness and humility. Keep bringing your high standards and expectation of excellence! Next year, consider finding ways to coach the more junior engineers in order to spread your skills and experience across the team.\n",
