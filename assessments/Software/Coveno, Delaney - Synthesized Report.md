## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

- I replatformed (rebuilt) the WeBDARt application on the SpOC contract as the only engineer, using a technology that was entirely new to me (Warp Core). When stakeholders were concerned about slow processing time on WeBDARt, I identified the Palantir bug which prevented faster processing time initially, refactored the code from python to typescript so that I could use a different Palantir repo to circumvent the bug, and refactored the implementation and architecture of the core app functionality, taking processing time from 8 minutes to a few seconds. This was a high visibility success which left a great impression on 2 of our highest level stakeholders on the SpOC Contract: SpOC Director of Innovation, Paul Contoveros, and Deputy Director of Innovation, Lt Col Homan (JJ). They were so excited about the optimization that they went up to Abel Hernandez, my PM, at Prodacity and asked: "Do you know Delaney Coveno? We heard about her optimizing the processing time; that was a concern for us and the operations folks. That's huge! We heard it took up to 8 minutes and is now just a few seconds. Is she here?"
- Getting OSIT to production. I joined the OSIT team and quickly came up to speed on their architecture. We impressed our customers by getting OSIT into SIPR production, despite a grueling path to prod. Since Warp Core lacks automated testing and I felt our procedures could be improved, I also established (with help and agreement from the app team) a path from NIPR to SIPR which ensures successful handovers from developers to design/PM, and makes sure testing of any feature does not fall through the cracks. My contributions to the OSIT team laid the foundation for the outcomes in production which have improved the fidelity and availability of OPSCAP reporting.
- Contributing to the efforts to build the Bifrost platform, which has the potential for huge outcomes in production. As part of the Bifrost team, I have helped create the Bifrost platform which will onboard applications to the Mission Manager platform and streamline their ATO process.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Dan Sanker:**
Delaney is an exceptional SWE who brings immense value to the team. She not only delivers high-quality work with every commit but also demonstrates a truly healthy growth mindset by taking advantage of every learning opportunity.

**Bryce Nguonly:**
It has been an interesting time learning with you about part of the dev/sec lifecycle. I really like how open you are to learning more about what goes into an ATO and the technicalities of it, and always making sure the work you do is towards that goal.

**Jeremy Viray:**
Delaney is a highly effective problem solver. Even when joining a conversation with little or no context, she’s able to quickly understand the situation and help guide the team toward a clear path forward. Her ability to identify actionable next steps, especially when the team feels blocked or stuck, is invaluable. Delaney brings clarity, momentum, and a sense of possibility to situations that might otherwise stall, and the team benefits enormously from her presence in those moments.

**Erica Chang:**
Delaney has been a great senior engineer on the team. She will bring forward ideas that help the team work better together/more efficiently, such as switching pairs more frequently so people are able to gain more context across all the different tracks of work. She always has an openness to learn and will ask clarifying questions that help the team stay aligned during planning sessions, especially in terms of architecture and implementation. She also keeps the mission in mind, ensuring she's doing valuable work when she's not able to pair with another engineer. She's also fixed the dev container, which allowed the team to maintain the same practices with regard to the code. She's also been very willing to pair with non-engineers, which has been valuable for myself as a non-engineer.

**Clark Pain:**
Delaney has stepped up to the challenge of this project and has taken on work outside of her comfort zone. She has shown grit and tenacity, and isn't afraid to speak up for what she believes is best for the team. She's been a great asset!

**Chris Johns:**
Delaney Coveno warrants an enthusiastic recommendation for rehire due to her persistent dedication to solving critical, highly complex platform issues, her role in defining infrastructure automation standards, and her strong commitment to team process optimization and knowledge sharing. Delaney is constantly driving forward long-running, difficult engineering stories while actively seeking to understand the strategic and compliance implications of the team's work.

**Steven Souto:**
Delaney is a very effective contributor to the engineering side of the house, asking great questions, participating closely in technical discussion, self-starter on tasks where she has little context, and picks up on topics that need additional clarifying. Pairing is also a breeze with Delaney; clear, concise communication and quickly picks up on new technologies and frameworks. I would like to see Delaney take a more rounded interest in the product in order to engage more fully in the product vision and thus help drive discussion on technical priorities

**Kenny Slater:**
I love Delaney's ability to dive deeper on complicated matters that affect the technical architecture of Bifrost. Delaney brings valuable insight and is not afraid to ask questions when situations don't add up. Delaney asks the questions that everyone is thinking and makes complicated problems seem easy.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Delaney because she consistently brings a positive attitude and strong work ethic to the team. Even though we haven’t worked closely on specific projects, her updates in daily standups show steady progress and ownership in improving the pipeline.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Dan Sanker:**
Start:
- Start taking a more formal leadership role. Your methodical approach and ability to find the *right* justified answer is a model for the team. 
Stop:
- I would change nothing. Her current approach is highly effective and should be encouraged.
Keep:Keep that disciplined, methodical approach. Your commitment to finding the *right* answer is what builds long-term quality.Keep that incredible growth mindset. It's infectious and raises the bar for everyone.

**Bryce Nguonly:**
Keep being open to asking clarifying questions. It helps me and probably others understand the actual topic at hand in more layman's terms. Sometimes the discussions are going way to fast and you typing in chat what an acronym means or actually pausing conversation clarifies and aligns the conversation. 




You also speak up when it seems like someone is not being heard/their opinion is not really getting through. By rephrasing their sentences you will continue to help others get their point across and not glossed over. 




Sometimes when we pair it feels like we get side tracked on identifying possible solutions. It makes for awkward pauses in the pairing, it would be nice to just acknowledge that we are semi soloing and put a timebox on it. Then come back and discuss our different solutions. This space is new to both of us, so it would help to do some research solo in certain scenarios.

**Jeremy Viray:**
Keep bringing that calm, grounded energy to challenging conversations and tough problems. You never appear visibly shaken or overwhelmed when navigating difficult situations, and that steadiness has a noticeable positive effect on the people around you. Your composure helps the team stay focused and confident, even when the path forward isn’t obvious. I’d like to see you lead more of our strategy discussions. Your insights are always on point, and having your voice drive the conversation would add a lot of clarity and direction for the team. Don’t hesitate to step forward, you have a lot to offer.

**Erica Chang:**
- **Keep** continuing to learn more about Kubernetes so that you're more comfortable in the space and will be able to apply/share those learnings to the rest of the team. 
- **Keep** sharing your experience as a software engineer to help inform some of the platform capability decisions we make and to increase the team's overall technical knowledge!

**Clark Pain:**
Keep expanding your horizons and digging into platform engineering. Keep speaking up for what you believe is right for the team. If I were to suggest starting anything, it would be great to see you coaching/mentoring others and spreading your attitude to others.

**Chris Johns:**
Keep Doing:
- Keep demonstrating technical persistence by leading the delivery of foundational platform components.
- Keep championing healthy team collaboration, rotation, and documentation practices.
Start Doing:
- Start formalizing and standardizing documentation for critical platform solutions immediately after delivery.
- Start focusing efforts on automating follow-on operational requirements.
Stop Doing:
- Stop sticking to single tickets for extended periods, even when feeling close to a solution.

**Steven Souto:**
Start pairing more regularly with our PM and security counterparts to get more context on the current state of Bifrost's mission. I could definitely see your communication skills being very useful when preparing for or communicating with stakeholders. I would also look for more opportunities to facilitate discussions for the team, perhaps looks for opportunities to have a discussion on engineering practice if you felt less fit to facilitate architectural or planning discussions. Also start being more deliberate with sharing feedback or creating time to share feedback with teammates. This isn't necessarily personal to you, the Bifrost team as a whole should be doing this more.




Keep asking good questions and delivering good software. You are very good at burning down tasks at a high quality, and pairing feels consistently productive and efficient.

**Kenny Slater:**
Start: I believe with your experience, you have the background to help make decisions as a team. There are times when decisions are being made that I feel you could help facilitate an argument for one way or the other. I feel you are not afraid to ask questions, but along the same path you should voice your opinion in decisions.




Stop: NA




Keep Doing: You truly do have a great attitude and a desire to learn. You learn quickly and are a pleasure to work on the same team.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
**Keep:** Showing up with the same positivity, initiative, and focus on progress. Your consistent effort in enhancing the pipeline and communicating progress clearly helps keep the team aligned and motivated. That energy and dependability make a real difference in team culture and delivery.
