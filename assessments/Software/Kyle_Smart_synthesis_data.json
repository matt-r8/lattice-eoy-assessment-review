  "accomplishments": "Unfortunately I have not have a ton of time to get a ton of accomplishments under my belt here, but I am proud of the following:\n1) Was able to quickly meet with the customer in person and establish a means to see them on a consistent basis and acquire access to the work environment they are in at Peterson Space Force Base. This impact will be shown in the fact that the users can put a face to a project/development team and if they have an urgent concern I can address it asap with the customer on prod. \n2) Was able to quickly get a good handle on how Palantir and worpcore work and begin to add value to the OSIT application and further drive development for the application while providing real value to the customer. This impact will be shown with the stories and tasks I complete within the application and with my team as I take on more and more tasks to help the other devs with the work load.\n3) Quickly got access to a reliable way to get on the SIPR network so that I can contribute directly on production when needed for the team. The impact here is felt by the team and client as before I got access, only two devs had access before, limiting how often the team could reach onto prod to verify bugs and address customer concerns. With myself getting access, I can assist the team by going onto prod and be another dev to access and work on prod directly.",
  "enps_comments": "**Evan Mladinov:**\n\u201cIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\u201d\n\n**Cory:**\nIt is difficult to judge this as Kyle is still new. So far yes.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\nKyle shows a strong willingness to do the work and continues to make progress in learning the platform. He approaches challenges with a positive attitude and is clearly committed to growing as an engineer. With more experience and confidence, he is on track to take on more ownership and contribute at a deeper level.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nKyle is new to the team and probably needs more time to display his commitment to these values, since the uncomfortable situations don't typically arise right away. That said, I'm confident he has the ability and desire to be a role model for Rise8. I recently took him aside for a feedback session where I shared a couple possible areas of improvement, and Kyle was extremely receptive and enthusiastic about the experience. His reactions increased my confidence in working with him.\n\n**Danny Benson:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Kyle because, even as a newer member of the team, he has quickly demonstrated reliability, capability, and a collaborative, positive attitude that makes him a pleasure to work with. He approaches his work with focus and consistency, completes tasks effectively, and actively seeks out professional development opportunities to expand his skills.\n\n\n\n\nKyle shows strong potential to take on more ownership of tasks and contribute at a higher level. He is also beginning to develop the ability to provide constructive feedback to teammates, which will strengthen team communication and collaboration over time. His combination of technical growth, willingness to learn, and steady, positive presence on the team makes him a valuable contributor, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again.\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Evan Mladinov:**\n\u201cIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\u201d\n\n**Cory:**\nI would recommend just really growing into being a Riser and taking on more to become a stronger contributor.\n\n**Roshni Bhanderi:**\n**Start**: Be more proactive in picking up tickets that challenge him. This will help build both technical skills and confidence.\n**Keep**: Maintaining a strong learning mindset and showing readiness to take on work.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nStart\n- Consider turning your webcam on from time to time. My webcam usage varies, and tends to be off more than it's on, but it allows \"conversation\" even while muted with facial expressions and body language. Your clothing, home decor, and random background items can spark the water cooler conversations that we usually miss out on since we're remote. I've personally like having video on for stand up and usually having it off the rest of the day.\n- Bragging / talking about the things you've done to get up to speed with Warp Core. I remember the couple of learning projects Cory built, and I know Kyle also worked on self-paced learning projects, but I don't remember being impressed with the creativity or scope of what he worked on.\n- Speaking up more. I hear some questions or push back from Kyle, but I feel like a senior engineer on a new platform would be more aggressive about understanding it. I haven't received any feedback from Kyle on things I can improve on, of which I can name a few, but I know he's new and Rise8 is more intentional about feedback than most companies.\nStop\n- I've noticed Kyle will pause or use filler words while putting his thoughts together. I also have to work on this - I've found keeping a GDoc journal of my activities each day has helped me organize my thoughts before the next day's stand up, and I can quickly and succinctly give my update. I also try to gather my thoughts when formulating an answer by saying \"I got you, I'll take a minute to think about this\" if I feel I need a longer pause. \nKeep doing\n- Being curious and persistent in the face of unclear next steps. Kyle's been great at speaking his thoughts when driving our pairing sessions\n\n**Mases Krikorian:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n",
