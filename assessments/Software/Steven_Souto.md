**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> From feedback, I recognize that I am an invaluable member of the team, contributing at the level of a leader in a almost all facets: product management, product practice, engineering practice, architectural design, and consistent feedback. I've demonstrated a consistently critical eye for quality that challenges and drives team members to push for more thorough solutions and research into our difficult problems. I see that I am also a leading engineering contributor, driving stories and efforts to completion and results at a rapid pace.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I want to start familiarizing myself more intuitively with the process of getting approval for a software system within the government's definition of safe and secure. Since losing Graham on our team who had an intuitive understanding of what can and cannot, should and should not be done, I've recognized that I could further drive our team toward an actual outcome if I had more understanding of what is allowed. And knowing what is allowed starts with what is expected, which I have a very basic understanding (ATO, RMF, NIST, etc).




I want to stop letting my emotions bring me "below-the-line" when engaging with my peers. I don't think I am ever actually un-kind, but I recognize a thinness of patience that results in a colder and more vacant delivery of feedback and collaboration. I believe this comes from having high expectations of my peers that are not often met. I am still trying to figure out if my expectations are too high or if I am simply too negative. Watching peers such as Graham, Delaney, and Clark, I can see that maintaining a positive attitude and keeping cool when there is a slow gear is always the best path forward.




I want to keep contributing at a high level as an engineer and proving myself as someone who has the capacity to quickly pick up new skills and apply them.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> We successfully handed off a user-adopted and highly available web and mobile application to SLD45 that continues to be used today with not a single reported outage since February of this year. I am very proud of the codebase we delivered and the way we set the platform team taking over the project up for success. Rise8 made a clear impression on SLD45 that we are a capable force for delivering outcomes at a speed unlike any other in the government sector. I also believe I left a tremendous impression of two our junior developers on the team as to what it means to be an engineering leader who keeps quality of engineering output and focus of mission at top of mind.




I facilitated almost all of the pipeline design discussion for the Bifrost team. The feedback I got personally from those meetings and mentions in retro showed that they were very effective at creating a clear picture of our vision and detailed enough to directly create many tracks of work in the backlog. I spent a lot of time becoming a fast expert on what and effective SecRel pipeline design looks like, drawing on my experience as a client on multiple pipelines. I even facilitated a discussion on an infrastructure pipeline, which I had no prior experience with since joining the team. I believe these discussion were able to more completely align our engineering effort on a vision and even allowed our security experts on the team to more clearly communicate our technical intentions to stakeholders. 




Finally, and maybe this isn't an accomplishment but rather a result of these accomplishments, it was shared to me that our "unicorn" anchor on Bifrost recommended me for anchor of the product team when he leaves. I learned a tremendous amount from Graham, not just technically but also as a communicator, and it felt amazing to be hear that. I strive to have the same level of intuition and confidence that Graham showed.

**Comment**:
> Steven is a foundational part of our team’s success. I’d describe him less as an engineer and more as a world-class problem solver. He approaches any challenge, technical, organizational, or product-related, with the same level of clarity and structured thinking. His ability to identify root causes, evaluate options, and steer the team toward the right path makes him invaluable. If there’s a complex issue to unravel, Steven is the person you want leading the charge.

**Comment**:
> Keep leading the charge on important topics, it goes without saying but your voice and opinion is held to a high regard on the team. Additionally, you’re great at breaking problems into digestible parts, and I really appreciate how you bring other engineers into the process early; often having small impromptu conversations or think sessions. Would love to do this more often. It gives all of us a chance to grow as problem solvers before the bigger team conversations.

**Comment**:
> You are very driven and mission focused. Every action you take is because it relates to a outcome that we want to achieve. Pairing with you always feels like we are working on a higher level issue on what our story is trying to achieve, not just the engineering effort that the story dictates. You have a great sense one when people are not aligned, and you work on mediating those differences.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> Continue to champion larger group engineering discussions. You always make great gameplans for how our discussions should go, and are very focused on what outcomes we want out of them. 
You have a great ability to forecast what engineering tracks of work need to be completed next. I think your role working along side product to create epics and break those down into digestible stories has been super impactful for the team. 
At the same note, sometimes when working on smaller efforts, you can blow up the scope of a particular story. I think its because of how rapidly the infrastructure we were working on was changing. If the scope of the story feels like its expanding, take a step back and think about if the spirit of the story is still being captured by the original story. If it is, then maybe lets just finish the original and add another filler to the backlog to account for the future work, if its not, lets capture the change we want to make in the story and reevaluate where were are.

### Stop
- Honestly, there are no behaviors I would want you to stop. Your current approach to your work is highly effective and greatly valued.
### Keep
- **Keep** leading our technical-planning and architectural discussions. The way you plan and hold these sessions is already at a high level, and it's a critical part of our team's success.
- **Keep** questioning the "why" and maintaining your strong, opinionated positions. This is incredibly valuable and forces the team to be more deliberate and thoughtful.

**Comment**:
> Over this year, I think Steven's facilitation skills and leadership capabilities have grown considerably.  He's shifted from arguing a point to guiding a conversation.  Working in the context of a fairly experienced team, he holds his own in the conversation while helping to elicit contributions from other senior engineers.  Facilitating architecture conversations and setting the standard for collaboration on the team has really helped clarify goals and unify the team on a tactical level.  On the technical side, as an app dev, he jumped onto a platform team and has been a solid contributor since the beginning.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Jumping into conversations with partners and stakeholders when needed. Take those leadership skills out for a spin!




Start: Leaning on your ability to figure things out via facilitation, asking questions, research, etc. to build comfort with ambiguity.  I truly appreciate your ability to spec things out, but also . . . accepting some ambiguity early on and trusting your ability to figure things out will give everyone a chance to lock in some details along the way.  If you optimize for detailed architecture, you get more unity but it takes more time, and you may not stick to the plan anyway . . . but it's always a balance.  You can figure out how/when to optimize the plan or optimize for speed/empowerment.  But this comment is more about building comfort with either option so that you can always make a choice.  




Continue: Facilitating team conversations effectively;  pressing the team for clarity when they are inclined to do hand waving; leveling up the team as they get closer to production and start focusing on outcomes.

- Stop: Steven can come across as impatient - slowing down for a moment to make sure you’re on the same page as the team or as your pair will go a long way in accelerating our pace in the longer run.
- Continue: Being a leader on the team and being an incredible technical problem solver. Sharing his opinions and thoughtfully engaging with our architecture and value stream. Actively shaping our team practices/ceremonies as well as team priorities and architecture.
