**Rating**: 3 - Solid Performer

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> 1. Be Bold: Leader because I've shown I can respectfully bring attention to things I think directly violate "the Rise8 way," defend my perspective on principle, and accept the outcome regardless.
2. Do The Right Thing: Leader for the same reason above.
4. Do What is Required: Leader because my teammates were surprised at how easily I cruise through the repetitive, mundane work of configuring OSIT and ODIE, resulting in deliverables completed ahead of schedule
6. Keep it Real: Leader because I make a point to graciously accept praise while calling to light the contributions of others who enabled my delivery
7. Outcomes in Production: Developing because I often need more time, explanation, or pairing to produce a deliverable in OSIT. ODIE was relatively easy because it was just a massive amount of templates configured in various layouts, but OSIT is more nuanced, custom code/configuration
9 Grow Mindset: Developing Contributer because, if the year was all work for Unified Platform, I'd mark Team Leader because of all the path finding work I contributed. I don't feel like anyone has a problem with my ability to contribute since I've transitioned to SpOC and Warp Core. However, I know I could have done more to increase my understanding of the platform in my time here.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- Enhance my daily log with weekly and quarterly summaries
- Deliver a respectable amount of daily 1-minute videos where I practice speaking coherently for a minute without pausing
- Video on for stand up every day
- Pursue coaching 
Stop
- Waiting to be asked for feedback
Continue
- Keeping a daily log of my activities
- Working side projects to keep my coding skills sharp

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. I've become self-sufficient in areas of Warp Core to be able to work productively on my own accord, increasing the velocity of our team to produce deliverables for the customer. I do my best to bring the perspective of "This part is monotonous, but we're extremely well taken care of, so I'm thrilled to be here" and "The mental hump of getting started is way more difficult than the actual work". 
2. Identifying and Eliminating Redundant Software
I observed that a client team was investing developer time in maintaining redundant software. I initiated a discussion to evaluate its necessity, which led to its removal. This saved the client an estimated $150,000 in developer effort and demonstrated our commitment to aligning with their strategic goals - not just executing tasks. This action strengthened our role as trusted advisors who advocate for efficiency and long-term value.
3. Leading a Path to Production and Creating Reusable Knowledge
I successfully led the deployment of an application to production, navigating a largely undocumented and complex process. Along the way, I captured every step - conversations, errors, screenshots, and decisions - into a comprehensive knowledge base. This not only surfaced critical process gaps, but also enabled us to give the client clear, actionable feedback. As a result, we improved existing documentation, created new self-service resources, and elevated the client’s confidence in our processes, evidenced by their positive feedback.

### Question 11
**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I would rehire Dan because he brings a consistently positive attitude, learns extremely quickly, and is always willing to take on whatever task is needed. His adaptability, strong work ethic, and willingness to jump into unfamiliar areas make him a reliable and valuable teammate. Dan executes quickly, delivers high-quality work, and approaches challenges with curiosity and enthusiasm. He has been a steady contributor and an asset to the team.
The reason I did not select “strongly agree” is because, at his senior level, I would expect to see more leadership and ownership over the “how” of our work. Dan excels in the what and the why, but in some cases I would have liked to see him step forward to lead implementation details or drive the technical direction more proactively. This is a relatively small gap, and I believe he is fully capable of growing into that level of leadership.
Overall, Dan is a quick learner, highly capable, and very willing to do what it takes. With increased ownership over the technical “how,” he would easily move into the “strongly agree” category for me.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## **Start Doing**
- Taking more ownership of the technical “how” by proactively leading implementation decisions, exploring solutions, and driving execution without waiting to be asked.
## **Stop Doing**
- Relying on PMs, designers, or other engineering leads for direction before moving forward. Avoid waiting for instructions and instead act on opportunities to improve the product or accelerate progress.
## **Keep Doing**
- Maintaining his strong can-do attitude, excellent client interaction skills, and reliable consulting presence. Continue being an A-player who is willing to help wherever needed and learns quickly in new situations.

**Comment**:
> It’s been great seeing how much Dan has grown and gotten comfortable with the Palantir Foundry platform in the past 3 months. This is a big team of many Engineers, but if i had more time to work with him on some of the features we started I can see him becoming a team lead on many of the above categories.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start sharing your learnings more often and proactively codifying or documenting them. You've completed some great work that is unique to the team, specifically with ODIE and the Analytics platform. I have personally learned a ton from you. Please start sharing that knowledge more broadly across the team and Rise8.




Keep maintaining your calm, honest, and direct demeanor. Also, keep constantly asking for support from other developers on the team. I value that you are vocal and always look for solutions by asking for feedback. Please continue taking the time to break technical concepts down and being hands-on with your explanation methods.

> Start: Embrace Calculated Risk-Taking and Autonomy 
We encourage you to increase your comfort with calculated risk-taking and self-guided exploration. It is crucial to developing technical depth to feel empowered to experiment independently even if that means occasionally encountering temporary setbacks or "breaking things" in a safe, isolated environment. This hands-on approach is a powerful way to accelerate learning and foster innovative problem-solving. 




Stop: Relying on External Initiative 
You should actively work on reducing the delay associated with waiting for explicit instruction or initiative from others. While we value thoughtful analysis and discourage rushing to solutions, it is essential that you feel empowered to proactively test concepts, prototype solutions, and independently investigate technical options. Taking the initiative to understand the inner workings of a system and the range of potential solutions on your own is a vital step toward tackling the actual problem with confidence and speed. 




Keep: Maintaining a High Standard for Engineering Growth 
Continue your impressive commitment to growing as a thoughtful and methodical engineer. You excel at following a rigorous process: diligently analyzing the core problem, developing well-reasoned solutions, and most importantly, seeking constructive feedback at key stages. Your ability to consistently solicit and incorporate feedback on your proposed solutions is an exemplary practice that significantly enhances the quality of your work and the team's overall knowledge base.
