**David Alvarado:**
Jacob joined the team a few months ago, and I feel our team has been better for it.  He has brought along his expertise gained from past experiences to the team and we have benefited.  He has initiative to pick things up and run with them and has been a really good pair.

I would enthusiastically rehire Jacobi. He is a great engineer who brings valuable technical knowledge and experience to the team. He challenges the status quo, asks good questions, and makes suggestions for team improvement. When he joined the team, his perspective was energizing and helped us rethink some of our approaches.

**David Alvarado:**
Please keep doing what you are doing, I have enjoyed working with you

**Pooja Jhaveri:**
To be a more collaborative and team-focused Riser, I would suggest you **start** communicating ideas and code changes early and more effectively. I would like to see you **stop** the tendency (that we all have, naturally) to allow context to be siloed on individual tracks that you are working on. Taking a more transparent and collaborative role on the team, intentionally communicating critical changes and passing along context earlier in the development, will help us all work better collectively. Lastly, please **keep** expressing your opinions and pushing things forward to help drive our team's performance. It's great working with you and glad to have you on the team!

**Jesse Wilkins:**
- Start: contributing to team conversations more and asking for help when needed
- Stop: jumping to conclusions without all the data
- Keep: taking ownership of work and being a strategic thinker on how to best accomplish it

**Drew McFarland:**
**START:** Getting more involved in prioritization conversations. There have been times where I could tell you didn't agree with how we prioritized our work, but you never said anything in the meeting. If you think we're going down the wrong path, speak up.
**STOP:** Holding back your opinions when you clearly have something to say. I can tell when you're biting your tongue, and it doesn't help anyone. Just share what you're thinking.
**CONTINUE:** Being the person who knows the answer to everything. Seriously, your knowledge is incredible and you're always able to point us toward a solution. That expertise makes you invaluable to work with.
