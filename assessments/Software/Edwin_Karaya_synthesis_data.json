  "enps_comments": "**Minh Nguyen:**\nYou have been a critical additional to the team this cycle, leveraging your tenure to expertly guide our newer engineering team in adopting not just Rise8 practices and core values, but the best engineering practices overall. Your push in integrating AI (Claude) into our workflow was crucial to our success in completing the complex ARA form from discovery to production in just 4 weeks. Your technical depth is already shaping future work; the Kahless team requested your input on Playwright for establishing automated testing pattern (fingers crossed that will be implemented). I appreciate your occasional chat and sharing in our Slack, as they help our team opens up and feel safe.\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\nIn the short time I worked with Edwin, he consistently brought clarity to unclear requirements by asking insightful questions and communicating clearly across the team. He proactively offered help and was instrumental in unblocking others (myself included) during the sprint. His introduction and championing of the Claude AI container had a real, measurable impact on development speed and delivery. Would love to see continued growth by occasionally stepping away from AI tools to keep critical and creative thinking sharp. \n\n\n\n\nFrom what I observed, he\u2019s performing near a Team Leader level. Overall, a solid contributor who made a noticeable difference during my time with the MW team.\n\n**Steven Souto:**\nEdwin is a very knowledgable engineer and has lots of experience. He has a sincere interest in helping others learn and often will take time to facilitate discussions of new concepts. He brings many ideas to the table and stays focused when there is a difficult problem to solve. There were occasional times where I was wanting to see Edwin have confidence in the strategy/mission and help drive a decision but seems to prefer to stay on the side of offering options. Edwin works really well with a confident anchor and PM, truly multiplying the engineering output. His ability to leverage LLMs for coding was also way ahead of the rest of the team very early on.\n\n**Bryce Nguonly:**\nYou are always there to help balance our team when we came across roadblocks. Always making sure that we revisited current problems or questions when we got more stakeholder info. I really miss the shareouts you would give when we needed were looking into a topic such as TDD for team norms.\n\n**Jeremy Viray:**\nEdwin has a deep understanding of modern development patterns, and he regularly helps the team grow by explaining concepts and guiding others through unfamiliar areas. Despite his expertise, he remains humble and curious, always willing to explore new ideas. When pairing, he listens closely, experiments with suggestions, and uses prototypes as a way to spark meaningful conversations about benefits and drawbacks. I'd love to be on a team with Edwin again anytime.\n\n**Hannah Cheng:**\nEdwin is an standout engineer because he possesses a rare and valuable combination of strong engineering skills (specifically in GovTech and TDD) and foundational User Experience knowledge. This dual skillset allows him to contribute deeply to design workshops and make empathetic decisions for the user. I have full confidence in his ability to support user research, where he frequently volunteers his time. Beyond his technical and product contributions, he proactively identifies risks and shortcomings, always offering constructive solutions. His lighthearted nature fosters trust and contributes significantly to our team's psychological safety and growth.\n\n**Roshni Patel:**\nEdwin is truly amazing to work with. He brings a positive, authentic personality to the team that makes collaboration both easy and enjoyable. I especially appreciate his transparency around his working schedule, it helps the team plan effectively and creates a strong sense of trust. His clarity, consistency, and proactive communication have made a noticeable impact on our team\u2019s ability to stay aligned and move quickly.\n\n**Shanna Chen:**\nEdwin has been a vital engineer on TAK, consistently delivering high-quality work and demonstrating deep technical expertise. I trust his inputs and judgment, knowing that he can execute complex tasks reliably and efficiently. Beyond his technical skills, Edwin is proactive in identifying potential issues and suggesting solutions, which keeps projects on track and strengthens team outcomes. His ability to collaborate, communicate clearly, and take ownership of critical work has made him an invaluable contributor to our team\u2019s success\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Minh Nguyen:**\n**Start**\nI hope you get a chance to start providing more technical architectural and design work that showcases your technical knowledge. I know you still have a lot in your tank but given the lack of context and our team is relatively new to the program, it will take time.\nGoing to at least one PI planning :)\n\n\n\n\n**Keep**\nBeing yourself and keep sharing things. I thoroughly enjoy your workout progress updates and cosplays\nPushing for more AI practices in our team to provide the best productivity we can achieve\n\n\n\n\n**Stop**\nNothing really\n\n**Vin Foregard:**\n**Start**: Try starting your implementation based on your own understanding before bringing in AI for optimization or feedback. This could help sharpen your intuition and strengthen problem solving muscles.\n**Stop**: Nothing major to stop, perhaps just a light check on over-reliance on AI generated code.\n**Keep**: Keep asking thoughtful, clarifying questions that bring clarity to vague requirements, it helps the whole team align faster. Keep leading the way on tools like Claude; your initiative meaningfully boosted sprint velocity, helped meet last minute changes, and made it easier for new engineers on the team (like me) to ramp up quickly.\n\n**Steven Souto:**\n**Keep:**\n- Demonstrating great engineering practice: refactoring, pairing, just the right amount of up front design\n- Facilitating valuable engineering practice or learning discussions\n- Keeping a positive, can-do attitude\n\n\n\n\n**Start:**\n- Taking more ownership over the mission, help look for road bumps that others might see\n- Make sure to keep an open mind for feedback and try not to think about your response before fully understanding the feedback. There were a couple times we had feedback session where I felt like you focused on making it clear that you knew about some behavior I noticed but I didn't feel as though you understood the way it affected me or the rest of the team. Listen for the part about how the behavior is affecting the person giving you feedback.\n\n**Bryce Nguonly:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n\n**Jeremy Viray:**\nI'd love to see Edwin in an anchor/team captain role, I think he would excel. Keep up your deep emphasis on growth and learning for the entire team!\n\n**Hannah Cheng:**\nPlease continue sharing your observations on risks and shortcomings, and keep coupling them with your creative ideas for solutions. Your willingness to experiment with new processes and product improvements is contagious - don't stop doing that.\n\n**Roshni Patel:**\n**Start:**\n- Start sharing more of your technical thought process during discussions. Your insights are valuable, and giving the team more visibility into your decision-making would help us learn from you and build stronger context collectively.\n**Stop:**\n- Stop second-guessing the value you bring. You consistently deliver high-quality work and communicate clearly; trust that your contributions carry weight.\n**Keep:**\n- Keep being transparent about your schedule and capacity\u2014it helps us operate smoothly and builds trust across the team.\n- Keep bringing your positive energy and personality to the team. It genuinely makes working together enjoyable and boosts team morale.\n\n**Shanna Chen:**\n**Start:**\n- Improving communication between internal team members about task ownership and status, so everyone is aligned and no work falls through the cracks.\n**Stop:**\n- Spreading yourself too thin across multiple tasks; focus on the work that has the highest impact.\n**Keep:**\n- Delivering high-quality, reliable work that the team can count on.\n- Being collaborative and supportive, helping teammates solve problems and grow.\n",
