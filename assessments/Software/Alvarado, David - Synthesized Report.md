<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

- Built a test app based on NOVA's dependencies and deploying to the platform in an effort to have a model that we can continually use to test the platform prior to NOVA being deployed.  Hopefully leading to a successful, streamlined onboarding for our first client in order to prove the value that FORGE provides
- Helped the Enablement find its place and responsibilities in the larger FORGE team and to find ways to best work with other Rise8 teams to accomplish the common goal of delivering a quality platform for out client.
- Anchored my initial team (automation) in the early stages of FORGE and started to explore early opportunities for automation and eventually helped in forming the opinion that the team was quite not structured correctly, which eventually lead to it being assumed into the Enablement team.

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Jesse Wilkins:**
- Start: Bringing more structure to conversations, think how you might break down your thinking and derive what the audience needs to know/cares about to communicate more effectively
- Stop: Feeling like you need to defend yourself and apologize, you’re a sharp thinker and provide valuable insight
- Keep: being a thought leader and technical expert for the team and being a thought partner to bounce ideas off and collaborate with

**Drew McFarland:**
**START:** Sharing your opinions more freely in discussions. You've got good instincts and thoughtful perspectives, but sometimes you hold back. The team would benefit from hearing what you think more often.
**STOP:** Sometimes it can be hard to follow what you're saying when talking through complex concepts.I think sometimes the important bits get buried in detail, which makes makes it hard to know what's important and what's just you working through it in real time.
**CONTINUE:** Being the optimistic, helpful person you are. You're always willing to jump in when someone needs help, and your positive attitude when we're facing problems honestly makes everything feel more manageable. The team is better because you're on it.

**Pooja Jhaveri:**
Please keep being a highly collaborative and team-focused Riser; your willingness to pair, your open and amicable nature, and your initiative to work with others are invaluable to our team's health and effectiveness. Your ideas and suggestions are great and an asset to the team - to ensure they are acted upon quickly, you can focus on being more concise when communicating. Practicing more deliberate and focused communication will help maximize the impact of your explanations and the context you are sharing. Please keep routinely voicing your concerns, frustrations, and successes often, as you have been. This ensures we assess risks and opportunities along the way, and helps drive our team’s success. It's great working with you!

**Jacobi Ayala:**
Start focusing on communication style. Take a pause to consider what you want to say and deliver it with confidence. If the words can't come out the way you want, check with clarification from others. Ex, "Do you get where I'm going with this?" or "Does that make sense or should I try to rephrase?"




I don't have a good stop recommendation.




Keep taking initiative on tasks and sharing out information that is learned.
