  "accomplishments": "Accomplishment: Create a path-to-production pipeline using Palantir's new marketplace. Investing into this new feature that Palantir provided has helped us accelerate our delivery metrics and ensure our customers receive the outcomes faster and more reliably.\n\n\n\n\nAccomplishment: Use the limit capabilities of the Palantir foundry framework to solve multiple problems and requests by the customer. These features, despite their limitation, helped the customer overcome many problems and carved the path to making our tool the only status reporting tool in the force.\n\n\n\n\nAccomplishment: Help the TAK team setup an AI training pipeline to improve our AI capabilities for the TAK challenge. The impact of this is yet to be known for its full extent, but our submission was deemed awardable by the government as of today.",
  "enps_comments": "**Roshni Bhanderi:**\nMases is a highly capable developer whose ability to debug and solve complex problems stands out across the team. He consistently tackles difficult technical issues with precision, even in cases where visibility is limited or direct debugging isn\u2019t possible. He also goes out of his way to support his teammates by pairing, sharing knowledge, and stepping in to help unblock others, which makes him an important strength on the team.\n\n**Kevan Mordan:**\nMases is an extremely strong SWE with a unique skillset and growth mindset. He is ready to take a team tech lead/anchor role and influencing at a high level\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nMases is one hell of a performer. He's new to Rise8 this year and has become an expert on the Warp Core platform in a short amount of time. If I didn't know differently, I'd assume he's been working with it his entire career. He's unfazed by obstacles or technical complexity and isn't easily deterred. I'm not at all surprised he was named anchor. His approach to work has made this an extremely easy review for me\n\n**Danny Benson:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Mases because he is a humble, highly skilled engineer who has consistently proven himself to be a cornerstone of the team. He is the person everyone turns to when troubleshooting complex issues\u2014even without visibility into the classified environment\u2014which speaks to his technical depth, problem-solving ability, and willingness to support others. His contributions were instrumental to the success of the COMET 2.0 integration, and he continually seeks to improve team efficiency, including driving meaningful automation around how we implement workshops with the OSIT product.\n\n\n\n\nBeyond his technical strengths, Mases brings a calm, thoughtful presence and works well with every member of the team. His intellect, collaborative nature, and genuinely pleasant demeanor make him someone I would welcome the opportunity to work with again. He is a reliable, influential contributor whose impact is deeply felt across the project and the team.\n\n**Cory:**\nMases is someone that I think is pivotal to this team. He is a great source of morale and connection for the team. He is also reliable with technical requirements and gives clear feedback with patience and without negativity.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nMases is one of the most skilled developers on the team and it shows in his quality and work ethic on the team. I have paired with him a handful of times, but each time I can see how knowledgable he is and how skilled he is at working in palantir/warpcore.\n\n**Abel A A Hernandez:**\nIt's been great seeing Mases's contributions to the product. He is always thinking of ways to make the warpcore development process more streamline and effective. He is constantly sought out by both Senior and Staff Engineers and Junior Engineers for support.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\nMases is an exceptional engineer whose performance has elevated him to a critical Anchor role within the team. His rapid acquisition of Warp Core expertise resulted in the development of several foundational applications that have directly streamlined OSIT implementation efficiency across the team. He also consistently exhibits strong mentorship qualities, demonstrating a proactive willingness to pair with and elevate the skills of his peers.\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nMases is a great software engineer to have on your team. He is a great communicator and does not give up on finding the best solution, even when things seem difficult (especially with palantir software). Mases brings a positive energy and open mindedness to the team with work we do. He takes the time to understand the expected outcomes and impact our work is doing and he is quick to help others understand technical aspects of application. He is a overall great team player.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nMases is a solid engineer who can work within the framework and quickly find solutions to problems.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Roshni Bhanderi:**\n**Start**: Taking a more active role in upholding quality standards across the team's work.\n**Keep**: Mases is great to work with and consistently brings a helpful and collaborative mindset to the team. He should continue sharing context, troubleshooting alongside others, and engaging thoughtfully in problem-solving.\n\n**Kevan Mordan:**\nStart: Being more confident, you have the skills and work ethic\nKeep: Showing up and doing the hard work\nStop: Worrying about stepping on toes, we're all here for the mission\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nStart\n- Giving feedback. I haven't received any from Mases, and I personally know some areas I can improve, but I know it's his first year at Rise8 and we emphasize feedback more than most companies\n- If he's not already, Mases could consider keeping a daily / weekly / etc journal of achievements to aid in bragging about himself in his self-review :-D\nStop\n- I know it's not helpful, but I can't think of anything Mases should stop doing\nKeep doing\n- Being a great source of knowledge for the team. He thinks critically about vague situations and readily helps us work through understanding. He's always been happy to explain how things work and brings enthusiasm to pathfinding efforts\n\n**Cory:**\nI do not really have any critiques or see any clear things to improve to reach the next level. Keep up the great work and I am excited for the move to anchor.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nI really like how easy it is to ask you questions on anything within Palantir, regardless how dumb the question is. I also like how you are able to explain very clearly what is happening and elaborate in a manor that makes sense to me. My largest piece of feedback is when you are working you move very quickly and at times it can be difficult to keep track of what is happening (I do anticipate this issue to alleviate as I get better at Palantir/warpcore).\n\n**Abel A A Hernandez:**\n**Start** being more vocal and sharing some of your technical methods, findings, and ideas across the team. Your specialized work, specifically your implementation of Layout Groups and your support with ODIE and the Quiver Analytics dashboard, represents huge contributions that go beyond the direct scope of the OSIT product. This work clearly demonstrates your rapid learning ability and deep expertise in improving not just our app but our processes.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep** maintaining your great qualities in cooperation, approachability, and coaching. You are a smart and patient person, which makes learning from you incredibly easy. Everyone on the team consistently looks to you to explain complex topics, figure things out, and provide guidance. Please continue to be the approachable resource the team relies on.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\n**Start increasing external visibility:** Proactively participate in client demos and stakeholder presentations to showcase the technical value of his work and build direct rapport with them.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop limiting engagement to technical implementation only:** Intentionally participate in client discussions and requirements gathering to ensure engineering perspectives are integrated early and to better align solutions with clients and users.\n\n\n\n\n**Continue focusing on developer enablement:** Sustain the focus on developing foundational tools and applications within Warp Core that systematically reduce technical friction and enhance implementation efficiency for the rest of the team.\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nOverall, Mases should keep doing what he's doing. There are no issues with his engineering work. He does a great job, he collaborates well with the team. He collaborates well with people seeking more technical understanding. I don't think there's anything he needs to start or stop in particular. He is a solid engineer. He is now starting an anchor role and I firmly believe he will step up as a leader. He has the qualities of one. He is a good choice for the anchor position.\n\n**Lambo Lamberson:**\nAs you step into the role of the anchor, start facilitating conversations around practices, improvements, and architecture for the other engineers. This role will require you to take a step back and think about the future, and be able to guide the other engineers toward that direction as they contribute code.\n",
