**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on the FORGE Enablement team because I consistently demonstrate the traits, behaviors, and results expected of an A Player.




My work this year has been focused on establishing the foundations necessary for enabling FORGE tenants to drive measurable outcomes in production once the platform is functional and ready for onboarding.




- **Impact and Results:** My team and I successfully deployed the NOVA mock application, which serves as the critical blueprint for future tenant application development & deployment on the FORGE platform. Through this, I have become highly effective in Kubernetes and am committed to building on that proficiency to become an expert on the product we are building. This work directly supports the team’s mission of enabling tenants and therefore the company mission to enable continuous delivery of outcomes in production.
- **Team Leadership and Health:** I serve as the engineering anchor and technical representative for our team, providing critical context and continuity for enablement. I lead monthly engineering check-ins to help establish and solidify team practices, I identify and help mitigate risks, and I shape the work we do by contributing to story writing and prioritization. I helped create the Domain Driven Design artifact for FORGE which clarifies and illustrates the value we are delivering. I am able to pivot and steer our team based on wider FORGE account and company changes (merging the enablement and onboarding teams as well as timeline, scope, and leadership changes). 
- **Growth Mindset and Initiative:** I am always looking to improve and try new things. This is demonstrated by the RiseU lighting talk I gave on the FORGE AI Chatbot POC (Rise8 Librarian), running & sharing Drumbeat experiments using Agentspace, and my integration of AI tools like Gemini and Claude to create rapid prototypes or facilitate learning about unfamiliar areas of platform engineering. Joining the book club and reading XP Explained along with other Risers helped me re-align to XP principles and gave me a newfound appreciation and motivation to adapt them for my team. My curiosity and initiative to learn, fail fast, and iterate quickly are crucial to helping me navigate the high-agency environment we work in.
- **Integrity and Collaboration:** I am committed to doing the right thing by proactively collaborating with the Platform and SecRel teams to troubleshoot deployment blockers, communicate failures or pain points, and map out the full onboarding flow, ensuring our FORGE delivery pipeline is robust. I also work closely with the FORGE IT Services team to refine our tenant onboarding process and collaborate on automation work. I have sought out and received positive peer feedback which gives me confidence that I contribute positively to the team.




I am a person of high integrity who consistently delivers on commitments and drives outcomes for my team (soon to be outcomes in prod), making me a strong team member, contributor, and leader whom I would enthusiastically rehire.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I plan to **start** driving innovation for the team by rapidly prototyping ideas and finding outcome-driven ways to integrate AI into our workflows. I would like to start formalizing my technical depth and fluency in kubernetes by preparing for and attempting the CKAD certification.




I will **stop** allowing the team’s development bandwidth to go to work without a clear, committed pathway to either a measurable user outcome for the FORGE account or a scalable company result, ensuring team initiatives are always channeled into maximum mission impact.




I will **keep** serving as the dedicated engineering anchor for the team, pushing our team forward along our roadmap and toward measurable outcomes in prod. I will keep leveraging my curiosity and growth mindset and take initiatives to explore, learn, and rapidly implement new technologies to generate value. I will also keep leading our internal engineering check-ins, refining our practices, sharing critical context, and prioritizing tasks effectively to maintain team health and propel our growth.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Establishing the FORGE Platform Enablement Blueprint**




- **Accomplishment:** Successfully built and deployed the NOVA mock application, which included key services and features like MinIO, PostGIS, Postgres, and Redis. The app also implements Kubernetes Secrets and integrates with FORGE's Keycloak. All images and dependencies are pulled from FORGE's Artifactory instance to ensure successful development in an air-gapped environment. I also spun up an OpenShift local cluster and created setup scripts for other team members to accelerate the development feedback loop.
- **Impact:** This accomplishment primarily supports the mission goal of accelerating the delivery of valuable software. By establishing this foundational app, I helped improve the efficiency and productivity of the FORGE onboarding and deployment process, refining the steps to promote rapid delivery of valuable software. This lays the groundwork for assisting tenants with the same onboarding and continuous delivery tasks going forward, which will help them deliver outcomes in production and generate warfighter value more quickly and painlessly.




### **Streamlining FORGE Tenant Onboarding and Improving Cross-Team Delivery Flow**




- **Accomplishment:** I proactively paired with the FORGE Platform, SecRel, and IT Services teams to troubleshoot deployment blockers, refine the deployment process, and communicate bugs. I also collaborated across teams to assess the NOVA team’s codebase and architecture to identify risks, make recommendations, and facilitate a smooth transition onto the platform. Additionally, I built great rapport with customers through weekly syncs, user research, and asynchronous collaboration to understand their needs/requirements to effectively help them onboard to FORGE.
- **Impact:** This directly enables continuous delivery and contributes to maintaining healthy customer/team relationships. Cross-team pairing has led to faster progress and removed roadblocks, accelerating the flow through the onboarding and deployment pipeline and contributing to the company's commitment to establishing continuous delivery and tight feedback loops. Streamlining the tenant workflow ensures that tenants can quickly deploy their software using our platform and consistently deliver valuable software securely and reliably, which is imperative to building a product customers love and trust.




### **Driving Internal Innovation and Engineering Excellence through Team Leadership, Learning, and AI Initiatives**




- **Accomplishment:** I served as the anchor and technical spokesperson for the team, guided and established our engineering practices, and helped push our team forward along our merged enablement & onboarding roadmap. I collaborated on building a proof of concept for an internal-facing FORGE AI Chatbot (Rise8 Librarian), and gave a RiseU lightning talk on the prototype. I also had one-on-ones with several Risers to understand their approaches to enablement, to share learnings, and to build camaraderie in a remote environment. 
- **Impact:** This supports company business results, growth & innovation, and healthy teams. Serving as the Engineering Anchor provided critical context and continuity, essential for a healthy team, and leading syncs directly supported the growth of the team overall. By utilizing and encouraging safe adoption of AI tools I have demonstrated initiative and identified opportunities for generating value for the company using AI. Lastly, connecting with Risers across the company has helped me build cross-team relationships and foster an environment where A Players thrive.

**Comment**:
> Pooja is the engineering partner every designer hopes for but rarely finds. She has a unique ability to translate complex technical concepts into language that makes sense without ever making you feel like you're asking a "dumb question." This creates an environment where I can focus on design decisions rather than fear of looking non-technical. She shows genuine care for our customers by engaging in conversations about what will actually work best for our customers. The psychological safety she builds through patient explanations and collaborative problem-solving unlocks faster iteration and better outcomes for the team. I'd request to work with Pooja on every team if I could. She represents the gold standard for what I want from an engineer on a team as a designer!

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **START:** Scaling your communication superpowers beyond individual interactions. Consider leading workshops or creating resources that help other engineers develop this skill of explaining technical concepts accessibly. Your ability to bridge technical and non-technical perspectives is rare and valuable. Rise8 would benefit from you mentoring others or taking on more visible cross-practice opportunities where this strength can have broader impact.
**STOP:** Being too polite when my ideas aren't technically feasible. I throw out big, sometimes unrealistic ideas on purpose (if all your ideas are technically feasible, are you really thinking big enough?) but I need you to call it out earlier when something won't work. Your kindness shouldn't stop you from telling me when an idea is technically stupid. That direct pushback saves us both time and actually makes our work better!
**CONTINUE:** Making technical concepts accessible without condescension. This creates psychological safety that unlocks better collaboration and faster iteration. Your genuine customer focus shows up in how you engage with the work, and your approach to cross-fucntional pairing sets the standard for how engineering and design should work together. All of this compounds into trust that makes hard conversations much much easier. I wish I could take an engineer like you to every team!

Stop relying on ai agents TOO much. That's not to say "don't use AI" because I do use AI, but I think getting personal exposure to the technology you want the agent to spin up first can help you guide it towards the path you want to go down more effectively. Also, there is some value in trying to trouble shoot something by hand and understanding the error at a base level before turning to the agent and saying "hey this is happening, what do you recommend to fix it?".




Keep learning and showing initiative to lead. I think you show a lot of potential as a senior lead if you keep expanding your knowledge and experience. Also remember to lean on your teammates. Don't get trapped into the mindset of "I need to know all of this". Teams are many for a reason. Everyone can be an expert in something different and we should all lean on each other and pull each other up.
