**Comment**:
> Of course i would hire myself, but im biassed. I am the one that brings the jokes.




This year marked my transition from Senior to Staff Engineer. While I successfully demonstrated my ability to communicate complex ideas and 'force multiply' by finding value for under-utilized engineers, I also learned a difficult lesson on the *FORGE* engagement regarding leadership styles. I realized that I over-indexed on granting autonomy to teams that actually required more prescriptive direction, which led to avoidable churn. Next year, my focus is on stabilizing myself in the Staff role by mastering the specific constraints of our industry (RMF/cATO) and applying a more 'situational' leadership style—knowing when to step back, but more importantly, knowing when to step in and dictate direction to protect the team and the mission.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **1. KEEP (Strengths & Core Value)**




*Focus: Strategic Communication, Force Multiplication, and Alignment.*
- **Translating complexity into clarity:** I will continue to leverage my strength in communicating complex technical strategies using relatable analogies (like my food analogies). This has been my most effective tool for building rapport and gaining alignment with non-technical stakeholders.
- **Proactive "Force Multiplication":** I will continue identifying opportunities to utilize under-allocated resources to de-risk future delivery. (e.g., repurposing idling engineers to build proof-of-concepts that improved Rise 8’s reputation).
- **Applying "Mission OS" to Client Strategy:** I will continue to move beyond execution and apply Rise 8’s *Path to Production* strategies to advise stakeholders. This approach was key to turning around difficult relationships this year by shifting the focus from output to outcomes.




#### **2. STOP (Inefficiencies & Bottlenecks)**




*Focus: Adjusting Leadership Style and Reducing Churn.*
- **Over-indexing on autonomy for inexperienced teams:** I will stop defaulting to a "hands-off" leadership style with teams that lack the context or maturity to self-direct. The *Forge* engagement highlighted that autonomy without guardrails leads to churn. I will shift to being more prescriptive/directive initially to reduce overhead and establish momentum earlier.
- **Hesitating to intervene:** I will stop letting the fear of "stepping on toes" prevent me from stepping in when a direction is faltering. I will trust my judgment to take ownership of a situation immediately rather than passively observing a decline in quality or velocity.
- **Working without Domain Mastery:** I will stop relying solely on external SMEs for compliance-heavy decisions. I need to internalize the constraints of the environment to lead effectively.




#### **3. START (Growth & Future Goals)**




*Focus: GovTech Mastery, Assertive Direction, and Business Growth.*
- **Mastering GovTech Constraints (RMF, cATO, Cybersecurity):** I will start deeply upskilling in the Risk Management Framework (RMF) and Continuous Authority to Operate (cATO) processes. To be a true Staff Engineer in this industry, I must be able to validate that my team’s technical direction is not just functional, but compliant and secure. This will build higher confidence with DoD stakeholders.
- **Situational Leadership (Prescriptive vs. Autonomous):** I will start assessing the maturity level of a team *before* deciding on a management style. For newer teams, I will provide explicit task breakdowns and architectural decisions until they prove readiness for autonomy.
- **Driving engagement growth:** I will start looking at client problems through a business development lens. I plan to use my stakeholder access to identify new opportunities where Rise 8 can expand its footprint, leveraging my growing communication skills to persuade leadership.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **1. Force Multiplication for Under-Allocated Teams** I identified a group of engineers who were allocated too early and lacked direction, and I proactively scoped meaningful R&D work for them. This converted potential "bench time" into demonstrated value, de-risking future delivery and reinforcing Rise8’s reputation for **outcomes over hours**. (i.e. onboarding an automation team and the path of creating golden path through evolving hello world app)




**2. Strategic Turnaround using "Mission OS"** I successfully stabilized a difficult stakeholder relationship by shifting the conversation from tactical execution to strategic alignment, utilizing Rise8’s *Mission OS* and *Path to Production* frameworks. This elevated the engagement from a standard vendor relationship to a trusted advisory partnership, ensuring we solved the **right problems, not just the easy ones**.




**3. Accelerating Decisions through Clear Communication** I leveraged accessible analogies to demystify complex technical architectures for non-technical DoD stakeholders. By bridging the gap between engineering complexity and mission impact, I reduced "fear of the unknown," built stakeholder confidence, and **enabled faster decision-making** in a risk-averse environment.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Adam brings an excellent knowledge of engineering practices and systems design. He has a strong bias for making progress and pursuing action directly which is extremely helpful for the teams that he is on. In general, he could also likely benefit from providing early intervention and guidance to less experienced teammates. He is one of the most proactive team mates I have seen in terms of offering his time to pair. I think the next level of this is in directly intervening and course correcting team mates when he sees this opportunity.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Speaking up and pushing back on clients/partners whenever needed, when you do this it is effective and I believe there is more opportunity for you to feel comfortable providing direct feedback in these situations. Use your experience to provide more explicit direction to less experienced engineers when needed.
Stop: Don't feel you need to hold off on providing feedback to teams or clients as your insight is strong and needed.
Keep: Your bias for action and support of your team members, it's a great asset to have in terms of maintaining momentum on your team. Helping your teammates maintain their focus on meaningful outcomes as the top priority.

He's have faced several challenges over the last few months and have shown strong perseverance, all while maintaining a positive attitude. He consistently focuses on doing what is right, balancing the needs of the organization with a strong sense of personal integrity.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep applying your exceptional diligence and thoroughness to your work. Your commitment to high-quality outcomes is a major strength and is deeply valued.
- Keep to demonstrating your willingness to learn and grow. It took courage to dive into this new, complex effort without having all the skills upfront, and your commitment to learning is fantastic.
- Start**,** when given a complex project, to break it down into "knowns" vs. "unknowns" to help the team and stakeholders set clear, achievable goals from the beginning.
- Start to leverage leadership and the wider team as a sounding board earlier in the process, especially when feeling stuck on ambiguity. Bringing others in to help set goals isn't an interruption, it's a valuable part of collaboration and keeping everyone aligned.
- Consider how "analysis paralysis" might be a source of stress. It's okay to not have every answer upfront, your ability to figure things out as you go is evident.
- Consider reducing the pressure to have a complete, perfect plan before you begin. On a complex project, that's a tough standard for anyone to meet. Try focusing on what it takes to begin, identifying the key risks and unknowns that need management, and balancing your natural thoroughness with the need for speed.

> Start - Trust your expertise and feel confident being the final sign-off for your work. Getting feedback and input is valuable, but it often felt like you wanted someone else to “sign off” so you wouldn’t get blamed if something went wrong. You consistently do great work, own it and let yourself take credit for those wins!




Stop - Nothing specifically comes to mind. Keep challenging yourself and stepping into bigger roles as you grow.




Keep - Working hard and staying engaged.
