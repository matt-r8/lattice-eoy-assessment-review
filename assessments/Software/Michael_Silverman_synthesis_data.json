  "accomplishments": "**Accomplishment 1:**\n\n\n\n\n**What I Did:** I spearheaded the implementation of DORA metrics for the Tracer team, developing custom scripts to extract automated delivery insights from our pipeline. Simultaneously, I identified that our current relational model (MySQL) was limiting Tracer's ability to map complex relationships. I led the research spike to transition to a Graph Database and am currently leading the execution of this migration. I am also preparing to present this architectural case study to the wider Rise8 engineering guild to share the \"why\" and \"how\" behind this shift.\n\n\n\n\n**Impact on Mission:** Implementing DORA metrics moves us from anecdotal success to data-driven continuous delivery, allowing us to objectively measure and improve our velocity\u2014a core tenet of the Rise8 philosophy. The transition to a Graph Database demonstrates our commitment to \"right tool for the job\" engineering; it ensures Tracer can scale to model complex compliance relationships efficiently. By presenting these findings to the org, I am ensuring that this strategic knowledge doesn't stay siloed, but elevates the technical maturity of the entire firm.\n\n\n\n\n**Accomplishment 2:**\n\n\n\n\n**What I did:** As the longest-tenured engineer on Rise8\u2019s only internal product, I drove the development focus toward \"usability and desirability,\" ensuring we aren't just building features, but building a product people actually want to use. I also led the technical groundwork required to deploy Tracer into the FORGE environment.\n\n\n\n\n**Impact on Mission:** By maintaining deep institutional knowledge and driving product quality, I helped transition Tracer from an internal concept to a viable enterprise tool. Preparing Tracer for FORGE directly supports the mission by scaling our impact\u2014allowing us to deploy our methodology across the many teams within that contract, rather than being limited by headcount.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n**Accomplishment 3:**\n\n\n\n\n**What I did:** I have been a consistent contributor to the engineering community, notably presenting the full Tracer architecture to the wider engineering team for review and critique. Additionally, I am an active participant in the book club and maintain 100% attendance at software practice meetings.\n\n\n\n\n**Impact on Mission:** By presenting Tracer, I broke down project silos, allowing the wider organization to learn from our architectural decisions (and mistakes). My consistent engagement in practice meetings helps reinforce a culture of continuous learning. This supports the mission by ensuring that we aren't just \"doing work,\" but actively sharpening the technical skills that we eventually export to our clients.",
  "enps_comments": "**Alden Davidson:**\nMichael stepped into the role of team anchor this year and has quickly grown to definitively deserve that title. He takes on the hard tasks that the company hands him and delivers, as well as proactively identifying architectural concerns in Tracer and strategizing how best to resolve them while staying focused on what needs to be solved to deliver value with Tracer. He brings an incredible focus on defining hypotheses and gathering metrics to validate his architectural decisions, and regularly shares out his ideas and proposals with the other engineers to gather consensus and bring us along in his learnings.

He brings immense value through his institutional history and his willingness to call out risks regarding scope or design gaps. He 'Keeps It Real' in the most productive way possible\u2014his delivery is always neutral, calm, and fact-based. This emotional stability allows him to challenge the team on technical decisions effectively, ensuring we maintain high standards without ever damaging team dynamics.\n\n**Paul Nieto:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Michael. He is a highly skilled engineer who consistently demonstrates drive, determination, and grit, often tackling challenges well outside his immediate area of expertise. He recently took ownership of Tracer\u2019s infrastructure migration and despite not being a platform engineer, he worked alongside Alden to successfully leverage AI to move the application from EKS to ECS and used AI to deploy Tracer to the FORGE platform. His ability to use AI tools to bridge knowledge gaps was impressive, and his consistency throughout that project served as an example to the entire team.\nMichael has also excelled in the Anchor role. He has taken full responsibility for aligning the team with software engineering delivery leads by implementing and updating DORA metrics. His technical foresight is equally strong; he proactively identified issues with our current database and took the initiative to research and facilitate a transition to a graph database to better suit the application's needs. From working on the backend and pipelines to creating Slack-integrated notifications, his versatility is invaluable.\nMichael\u2019s deep command of the Tracer domain and codebase allows him to contribute insightful ideas during meetings and maintain high standards for team norms and coding practices. All these things make him invaluable to Tracer and a key asset to the team.\n\n**Justin Reynolds:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Michael for any role at Rise8. Having been on two contracts with him, I know him as a technical expert who improves others and operates flawlessly in high-agency environments. He consistently does the right thing and what is required. While he leans introverted, he does not hesitate to speak up where he holds conviction. He has been a consistent A-Player for a significant portion of Rise8's existence.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Alden Davidson:**\n- Keep doing hypotheses-based experiments to discover and validate improvements to how we do business; whether it's gathering DORA metrics or ideating the conversion to a graph DB, the fact that you do the leg work to gather the hard numbers necessary to prove or disprove your ideas is a killer skill.\n- Start being more aggressive with taking time to do anchor activities; sometimes I worry that you prioritize pairing over taking the time you need to ensure the tasks being levied on you, as anchor, by the company are being accomplished well without overstretching yourself. Especially with the introduction of AI pairing, you should make sure you're taking time out to focus on fulfilling the anchor role, trusting that your fellow engineers will still have pairing support and will be able to satisfactorily fill you in when you step back into pairing.\n\n**Mary Pollin:**\nKeep Doing - Continue to leverage your profound domain knowledge and technical skill to ensure the robustness and health of the Tracer platform.\nKeep Doing - Maintain the critical habit of challenging assumptions and asking great questions to secure strategic alignment and mitigate project risk.\nStart Doing - Proactively insert your technical expertise into all strategic planning meetings and architectural decisions to formalize your influence.\n\n**Dave Chapman:**\n**Keep Doing:**\n- **Being the \"Voice of Reason\" & Anchor:** You are the steady hand on this team. Keep using your deep historical knowledge to prevent us from repeating past mistakes. I value how you \"Keep It Real\" by raising flags when work isn't scoped well or requirements are vague\u2014you protect the team's capacity this way.\n- **Maintaining Emotional Stability:** Your \"cool as a cucumber\" demeanor is infectious and vital. Keep bringing that neutral, fact-based approach to heated discussions; it allows you to challenge ideas effectively without anyone feeling attacked.\n- **Enforcing Rigor:** Keep holding us accountable during stand-ups and retros. If a discussion goes too deep or a story lacks clarity, you are usually the one to call it out. Please continue to enforce that standard.\n**Start Doing:**\n- **Act like an entrepreneur in your domain:** I want you to take 10-20% of your time to explore the \"art of the possible.\" Don't just wait for a ticket; research technical features our competitors have, find open-source tools we can leverage, and bring proactive proposals to the table.\n- **Bring prototypes, not just reports:** When we do Spikes or exploration, I want to see more than just written analysis. Bring back working software, mockups, or a branch with a tool integrated. Show us what is possible through demonstration rather than just description.\n**Stop Doing:**\n- **Waiting for explicit direction to innovate:** Stop relying solely on Product to define every improvement. You have the most senior technical perspective on the team\u2014I want you to stop hesitating to share your own ideas for features. Don't just execute (or critique) what is assigned; challenge the status quo with tangible examples of how we can be better.\n\n**Paul Nieto:**\nStart**:** I would encourage Michael to contribute even more to domain discussions. Given his years on Tracer, he possesses a phenomenal command of the codebase and the domain. While he always provides insightful ideas when he does speak up, his understanding is so keen that increasing the frequency of his contributions would be invaluable to the team.\n\n\n\n\nStop**:** There is nothing that comes to mind that Michael should stop doing as he is currently doing a great job in all areas.\n\n\n\n\nKeep**:** Michael should continue to display the drive, determination, and skill that have defined his work this year. He consistently does the hard work even when it lies outside his immediate expertise. He should also continue the good work he has done as anchor for the team, keeping the team aligned with the delivery lead expectations of our team.\n\n**Justin Reynolds:**\nKeep being the reliable technical expert and A-Player.\n\n\n\n\nI believe Michael is at a level where he can transition from a line software engineer to a more mentorship-based role. I would like to see him take on teaching opportunities, like at open office hours or by giving a lightning talk. He has a lot to offer.\n\n\n\n\nAs a teammate, Michael is great; the only behavior would be to keep loosening up to build that camaraderie. I think him sharing information across software engineering or taking on a role of greater influence (like prod patrol or assisting in the internal site) would be a-player attributes at the next level.\n",
