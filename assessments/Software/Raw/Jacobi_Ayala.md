### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **START:** Getting more involved in prioritization conversations. There have been times where I could tell you didn't agree with how we prioritized our work, but you never said anything in the meeting. If you think we're going down the wrong path, speak up.
**STOP:** Holding back your opinions when you clearly have something to say. I can tell when you're biting your tongue, and it doesn't help anyone. Just share what you're thinking.
**CONTINUE:** Being the person who knows the answer to everything. Seriously, your knowledge is incredible and you're always able to point us toward a solution. That expertise makes you invaluable to work with.
