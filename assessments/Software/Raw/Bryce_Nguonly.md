**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> This has definitely been a more challenging second half of the year. Joining a platform team is completely new to me and its been quite a learning curve. I feel like I have a good grasp of the technologies and how to actually complete the technical work and follow on next steps. But Im not quite there yet in terms of seeing the bigger picture. For example, its hard for me to identify what epics need to be made and how they fit into the end service that Bifrost is providing.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Taking more individual time to read documentation/get familiarized with tooling. Platform skills are different than traditional software skills, and require a bit more context. Learning on the job/during a story is helpful but sometimes frustrating for me/my pair. It would be more helpful to start at the same knowledge level of how tools worked. 




Start: Casually bouncing between pairs to see how certain things were implemented. Theres so many tools that go into platform work, so its really hard to tell the history/reasoning behind certain decisions because I may not work on that tool for weeks. So I want to be more proactive on making sure I get to see updated tooling. 




Stop: Being so passive during architecture/process discussions. These pipeline discussions require so much context so its hard not to get lost in the small details. Sometimes I've found myself stuck on a certain segment of the discussion that I've lost track of how the discussion got to a certain place. 




Keep: Learning about the ATO process and its technicalities/details/reasons. Just having Kenny and Tiyyba as resources has been immensely helpful. I feel like I learned so much about the ATO process that I maybe would never know just working on app teams. ATO is more a tangible thing to me now than ever, and this info will definitely help when going back to an app team. I think I've really learned the reason for document collection and how/why certain AOs want it a certain way.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Submitted first outcome in prod: 
On Nimbus I helped submit our first outcome in prod. There was a lot of challenges and learnings from that. Mostly coming back to the fact that we should always be working toward an outcome in prod. The stories we work on should have a clear path on how they relate to an outcome. Now on my second team at Rise8, I have a better understanding on the end to end process of what is required to put an outcome in prod. 




Leveraging AI:
My usage of generative code AI has skyrocketed this year alone. From maybe 5% to 85%+ of the time. Its helped me gain context on unknown topics or technologies without having to know the intricacies. I can focus on the more important aspects, such as building test or delivering quickly to gain faster iteration cycles. Using AI has helped me think at a higher level all the time, making sure the work I am doing is directly impacting users of my products/services. At the same time, I was able to jump right into platform work and make a contribution to the team without much technical background in the area. 




Closing down Nimbus:
Although Nimbus/SLD45 weather app did not continue, I learned how to leave our users in a safe place. What I mean is that our application will still provide its users value, despite not having active development/support. Even though theres not an active Rise8 team working on Nimbus, the project is in a state to picked up and immediately have tracks of work that would add more user value. It was a good learning experience, on knowing when/how to make decisions on certain features. And how not to leave production applications in an incomplete state.
