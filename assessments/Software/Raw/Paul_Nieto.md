### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I think my teammates would rehire me because I consistently demonstrate the ability to quickly adapt to new domains and drive outcomes in production, regardless of the technical environment. This year, I transitioned across three distinct projects (Kessel Run, MOSS, and Tracer) and successfully ramped up on each to contribute to a total of 15 end user outcomes and 2 supporting outcomes. On MOSS, I stepped into a senior role to lead critical integrations and the final delivery and handoff, work that directly contributed to our team winning the Dream Team Culture Award. I've done the technical work, I have the domain knowledge/experience on Tracer and actively use it to contribute to important discussions that direct production direction, and I work well with my teammates. I strive to be congenial and easy to work with while actively elevating the standards of those around me; I invested significant time pairing with teammates like Justin to reinforce development best practices, ensuring that I am not just delivering individual contributions but helping my teammates grow themselves. I constantly look for ways to improve our workflows and have embraced the adoption of AI-driven development on Tracer, putting time in with the team to learn how to best use it which has accelerated our ability to complete stories and debug complex issues. From facilitating retrospectives in Figma to conducting external interviews, I aim to be a teammate who not only ships code but actively elevates the team's and company's standards and morale.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: contributing to the strategic and technical direction of Tracer while continuing to develop the effective use of AI within our workflows. I will continue to step up to facilitate team ceremonies, improve our codebase technically, and actively participate in defining Tracer’s future on the FORGE platform as I have been doing this year by contributing my former Tracer experience and domain knowledge. I will also continue to leverage AI tools like Gemini and the Claude container to accelerate our development while also conducting more experimentation like our recent "John Henry" tests to help us understand how to apply AI to our use cases.
Start: leading the charge on delivering Tracer’s first user outcomes in production on the FORGE platform. While we have made significant progress with STIGs and platform setup this year, the ultimate measure of our success is putting value into the hands of the user and I want to ensure we hit that crucial milestone this year. To support this goal in particular and the team in general, I will start developing my technical and non-technical skills both inside and outside of the workplace. I plan on getting a Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA), keeping up with the newest AI developments, among other things.
Stop: leaving the ownership of Tracer’s value stream map, drumbeats, and broader product strategy exclusively to product. While I have contributed significantly to the technical direction and domain specifics, I feel that I've functioned more as a thermometer in this regard, simply receiving the work product has done rather than actively contributing to it as part of the team. Up to this point Tracer has not delivered outcomes in product and to ensure that we do this year, I need to understand our direction and assist there, specifically in the FORGE context. By stopping being passive and becoming intimate with the strategic landscape, I can better help the team pivot towards the most valuable opportunities and ensure our technical execution is aligned with our mission goals, especially considering the new potential opportunities Tracer has on the horizon.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Delivering 15 user outcomes and 2 supporting outcomes on the teams I've been on this year (Kessel Run and MOSS). This directly impacts Rise8's mission by contributing a significant portion to the company's annual total and moving us closer to the BHAG of 50,000 outcomes in production by 2040.
2. Transition to senior role and rapidly taking on those responsibilities on MOSS with 90 days left on the contract so that our team finished strong and earned the Dream Team award. I took ownership of complex technical challenges, such as identifying a database optimization issue where a single table was growing out of control unnoticed (consuming nearly a gigabyte of memory) and led the research and communication on multi-tenancy with our platform providers. Furthermore, I prioritized mentorship by pairing with a new Skillbridger to ensure they could contribute effectively and managed vendor relationships with Duality to the plaudits of our stakeholders. These efforts ensured MOSS continued to deliver outcomes and satisfy stakeholders without blockers as the contract drew to a close, even delivering a crucial feature right at the end of the contract. This impacted Rise8's mission by producing outcomes and having happy customers.
3. Joining Tracer again and helping the team move forward on the FORGE contract. Tracer is an important part of FORGE and because of my former experience in the domain and on the team, I freed up other engineers to focus on critical FORGE-specific work like getting Tracer on FORGE and other important milestones. I also have contributed to discussions in the domain as we continue to identify the direction in which to take Tracer as requirements and direction shifts on FORGE. This impacts Rise8's mission by ensuring Tracer will be successful in it's part on FORGE which in turn contributes to the success of the entire FORGE platform and thereby impacting Rise8's mission of getting outcomes in production.

**Comment**:
> Paul is an absolutely stellar teammate and strong engineer. He is always thoughtful and calm, providing a measured response to challenging problems and circumstances - and in turn, this serves as a mediating influence for the rest of the team. Paul has a depth of experience, but doesn't let that block him from always being open and eager to learn new things and have his mind changed by the perspectives of others. His kind and trust-building demeanor elevates the overall dynamic and tenor of the team, and is always pleasant to work with.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep challenging and being open to being challenged; you do a great job presenting your opinions in team discussions but not holding onto them dogmatically particularly when presented by the evidence and perspective of others.
- Keep encouraging your teammates to do regular feedback; I get the sense that you do attempt to get some end-of-pairing feedback started sometimes, and that's a great habit that I think a lot of us struggle with. Keep leading by example, we all need it especially when it comes to feedback!

**Comment**:
> Paul is an excellent engineer whose combination of technical depth and cultural positivity makes him a force multiplier for the team. This year, he was the anchor for our delivery cadence; he successfully led the effort to maintain Tracer's feature velocity while the rest of the team was heads-down on deployment and environment challenges.




Paul constantly seeks to deepen his understanding of the domain, frequently initiating high-value discussions that ensure the team is solving the right problems, not just writing code. He also brings creativity to our process, notably leading the informative 'John Henry' AI experiment. His engineering expertise is an asset, but his attitude is what truly sets the tone for the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Paul should start leveraging his experience with MOSS to guide Tracer toward outcome-based delivery. While we aren't fully in an outcomes-environment yet, I want Paul to take a lead role in preparing our mindset for it. He has the background to help us define *why* we are building a feature, ensuring we are ready to measure value, not just velocity.




Keep: He should keep his incredibly kind and uplifting attitude. No matter the stress level or the complexity of the problem, Paul is always ready to lift up his teammates. It is not just *what* he says, but *how* he says it—he creates psychological safety that allows the team to take risks and learn. That energy is indispensable.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Paul, with no reservations. He is a genuine value multiplier for the team. Paul is undoubtedly one of the catalysts that put the MOSS team on the ballot as the dream team. He quickly adapted to the needs of the company, onboarded rapidly, and immediately delivered outcomes. This definitely shows that he is willing to "Do What is Required" and has the "Grit" to see it through. He absolutely embodies the hypothesis-driven mentality outlined in XP Explained. He is always willing to mentor, coach, and roll up his sleeves to dig into complex problem-solving. Paul is incredibly empathetic, kind, and exhibits A Player behaviors better than other software engineers I have seen at his level.

**Comment**:
> Absolutely keep the mentor attitude. This approach pays dividends in his investment in other Risers and is one of the unique qualities that makes him so valuable.




The only area I see for next-level growth would be to step into areas of increased influence and responsibility beyond his current assigned level. He has valuable contributions at SWE open office, but he could influence at a more organizational level in a lightning talk. Though I see him as an absolute A Player, this is what I see putting him on that next level & being a no brainer for promotion.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Paul. He brings deep technical knowledge, strong curiosity, and a thoughtful, kind presence to every interaction. His communication is excellent—he consistently asks strong questions, contributes meaningfully in discussions, and provides clear asynchronous updates that help product and design stay unblocked. He’s reliable, collaborative, and incredibly easy to work with. He makes the team smarter, steadier, and more fun, and he embodies the values we want at Rise8.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start:**
Start leaning even more into expanding your front-end expertise and taking ownership of how our design system gets implemented. You’ve mentioned how much you enjoy front-end work, and I would love to see you influence things like MUI tokens, grids, and design-system alignment between code and Figma. You have great instincts here, and stepping into more of an advisory role would be valuable for both engineering and design.




### **Stop:**
Honestly, I don’t really have a strong “stop” for you. The only thing I’d offer is to stop waiting until later in the sprint to raise UX or interaction questions—you’re really good at spotting edge cases and inconsistencies, and surfacing those even earlier helps us all stay aligned and reduces rework. 




### **Keep:**
Keep bringing your curiosity, reliability, and willingness to speak up in team discussions. Your thoughtful questions, kind communication style, and steady presence are huge assets. Keep being flexible, proactive, and generous with pairing—you make it incredibly easy and enjoyable to collaborate. You’ve been such a great addition since returning to the team, and your positive impact is felt every day!

> Paul is a Senior Engineer who never seems to have an 'off day.' I would enthusiastically rehire him for his stability, reliability, and incredible level of engagement. In just a few short months, he has established himself as a key voice in our debates, helping the team reach consensus through active listening and restating. He is kind and pleasant, yet he never shies away from expressing his opinion to ensure we are building the right thing. His presence guarantees that our technical discussions are productive and inclusive.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing:**
- **Driving Consensus through Active Listening:** You are excellent at "debate" type discussions. Keep doing exactly what you are doing: re-articulating, restating, and asking clarifying questions. You are the reason we achieve a shared mental model between Product and Engineering.
- **Being Vocal and Engaged:** I value that you are always "on." When others are quiet or off-camera, you step up to fill the void with productive dialogue. Your engagement is a model for the rest of the team.
- **Bringing Positive Consistency:** You are stable, reliable, and pleasant to work with every single day. That consistent energy helps the team dynamic immensely.
**Start Doing:**
- **Act like an entrepreneur in your domain:** I want you to take 10-20% of your time to explore the "art of the possible." Don't just wait for a ticket; research technical features our competitors have, find open-source tools we can leverage, and bring proactive proposals to the table.
- **Bring prototypes, not just reports:** When we do Spikes or exploration, I want to see more than just written analysis. Bring back working software, mockups, or a branch with a tool integrated. Show us what is possible through demonstration rather than just description.
**Stop Doing:**
- **Waiting for explicit direction to innovate:** Stop relying solely on Product to define every improvement. You have the seniority and the history with Tracer—I want you to stop hesitating to share your own ideas. Don't just execute what is assigned; challenge the status quo with tangible examples of how we can be better.
