**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I ramped up quickly and contributed across both frontend and backend, helping move features from discovery to production. I asked clarifying questions early and paired with teammates so I could contribute instead of shadowing for too long. During onboarding, I also created a developer onboarding document based on what I learned in my first weeks. It was received positively and can serve as a reference for future engineers joining the team.




In the second half of the year, I worked on end to end features that touched the UI, API, and database layers, while looking for places to reduce technical debt, improve testing, and refine pipelines. When I noticed gaps in the acceptance testing process, I proposed a lightweight improvement to reduce flakiness. I also approached AI as a learning tool rather than a shortcut and shared insights with the team through weekly discussion sessions when the CUI restrictions prevented direct usage.




I believe I would be rehired because I stay curious, deliver outcomes, and try to raise the bar where I see opportunity. I focus on contributing value, learning fast, and supporting the success of my teammates as much as my own.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
I want to start sharing more of my learning process with the team, especially around problem solving, architectural decisions, and experiment results. I also want to improve how I communicate technical decisions so that both technical and non-technical teammates can easily understand the reasoning behind an approach. As I gain more domain knowledge, I want to mentor newer engineers and help accelerate their ramp up the way others helped me. Over the next year, I want to continue developing my technical leadership by improving how I communicate decisions and help the team move faster through better alignment and faster feedback loops.




**Stop:**
When new issues come up during implementation, I sometimes try to work through them on my own instead of pausing to realign with the team. I want to stop doing that and bring those questions up earlier so we can validate assumptions and avoid rework. This will help build stronger alignment and save time for everyone.




**Continue:**
I will keep pushing for outcomes in production and continue working end to end across the stack. I want to keep pairing, sharing context, and improving documentation so knowledge is easier to spread. I will continue to approach challenges with a growth mindset and use them as opportunities to learn rather than slow progress.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **1. Strengthened Team Collaboration and Feedback Loops Through Pairing**
I encouraged sharing feedback at the end of each session on what went well, what could be improved, and possible next steps. Creating space for both pros and deltas helped surface blockers early and kept communication open. This improved alignment, accelerated decision making, and supported healthier collaboration across the developers. I also contributed to clearer code organization, naming conventions, and documentation, which made shared work easier to maintain. These efforts supported Rise8’s values around feedback and a growth mindset. 




**2. Delivered End-to-End Features Across Multiple Teams and Domains**
Throughout the year, I contributed to both Blitzar and Nebula (formerly Mission Workup), working across frontend, backend, and database layers to deliver features such as event polling, authorization workflows, and CRUD operations. Switching between projects required rapid context shifting, domain learning, and adapting to different workflows and stakeholders. In some cases, such as building the SMTP service in Java, I stayed with problems until I found a solution, even when integration requirements were unclear at first. This helped move both projects toward production outcomes and supported Rise8’s ability to shift resources to priority work without losing momentum. 




**3. Improved Testing and CI/CD Reliability**
I restructured the GitLab pipeline to support feature flag testing using separate jobs with clean environments. This resolved exit handling issues and made the testing flow clearer and easier to maintain. I also identified gaps in the acceptance testing process and proposed lightweight improvements to create more consistency and confidence before release.




These accomplishments reflect Rise8’s values of outcomes in production, no unnecessary rules, and a growth mindset. They contributed to mission impact while helping improve team efficiency and delivery practices.

**Comment**:
> Vin is an outstanding engineer who likes to get his hands dirty in the codebase immediately. He has a strong set of opinions but loosely held, adapting to team agreements and practices. Vin gives feedback on situations but is a team player that goes with what the team evenly decides on as a whole. He is not afraid to take on challenging tasks, taking notes along the way, and share his learnings with teammates.




I'm extremely proud of Vin being able to switch context and support two teams when called for. He provided significant value to the other team to help them achieve their last minute requirements that was given by stakeholders.




Vin has a great personality and is always enjoyable to pair with.

**Comment**:
> I strongly agree that I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.  Vin has shown strong technical skills, quickly ramping up to both the work on Blitzar and Kahless and has made valuable contributions to both.  He has demonstrated his commitment to doing right by Rise8 by twice jumping onto the mission workup team to assist with deadlines/people outages.  Even while supporting the other team, he made a consistent effort to stay connected with our team and our progress, seamlessly reintegrating when returning.  Vin also brought back valuable insights from his experience working in the Kahless system, including processes and knowledge of the microservice ecosystem implemented, which helped improve our own team's understanding and velocity.  Vin is also great to pair with, as he is highly collaborative and responsive to feedback.  He brings valuable perspective from his past experience, and I've personally learned useful patterns and tips from working with him.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Vin because he is the definition of a "mission first" contributor and an immediate force multiplier on our team. Since joining, he has knocked it out of the park with his adaptability, technical depth, and eagerness to tackle the hardest problems.




Vin embodies flexibility. He immediately fit into our culture and proved to be an invaluable asset by surging to the Mission Workup team without hesitation, jumping into a completely different tech stack and CI/CD pipeline. The fact that his efforts helped "rescue the program" speaks volumes about his impact and dedication.




He is a great problem solver, especially under pressure and ambiguity. His ability to dive deep into a new codebase and successfully figure out the source of "weird behavior" shows he's not just a surface-level coder, but a smart contributor capable of articulating complex insights.




He is a smart and dependable contributor who has already proven he can achieve outcomes in production while embodying our company values.

**Comment**:
> Keep living the "mission first" mentality. Vin should continue to show his cross-functional flexibility, both by diving into unfamiliar codebases and by being willing to help surge other teams when the mission demands it. He should also continue to invest time in deep problem-solving within new codebases.




Start getting involved in Rise8 knowledge sharing. Now that he's onboarded and comfortable, he has a ton of high-value, practical experience to share, especially around problem-solving in new codebases and CI/CD pipelines. He could start by preparing a short presentation or "RiseU" for the broader engineering community.




There is nothing Vin should stop doing at this time. He is already operating at an extremely high level and is a model for how a new team member should contribute.

> Vin is a highly valued and reliable team player who consistently delivers and demonstrates exceptional commitment to the success of multiple teams.




For the last several months, Vin has shown outstanding dedication to the broader organization by splitting his time between the Quake and Mission Work Up teams. This effort not only back-filled critical engineering capacity to ensure both teams met their commitments but also allowed him to serve as a key conduit for knowledge transfer. He successfully integrated learnings and best practices across both teams, making them collectively stronger.




Vin is highly proactive in his approach to project execution. He is reliably vocal about technical derisking early in the process and provides clear, actionable feedback when needed. This focus on communication and mitigating risks makes him a consistently dependable contributor and a great partner for improving overall team quality and stability.
