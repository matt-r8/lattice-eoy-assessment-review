**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired by my teammates. Throughout the year, I have proven to be a reliable, outcome-oriented, and collaborative engineer who actively works to improve not just the product but also the team's capabilities.




- **I deliver high-impact outcomes:** On MOSS, I pushed rapid fixes to solve user-reported performance issues and was a key driver in shipping the complex DSR integration, directly improving mission capabilities.
- **I am a proactive collaborator and knowledge-sharer:** I took my mid-year goal of "more pair-programming and knowledge sharing" to heart. Upon joining Polaris, I fully embraced its pairing culture. I also proactively scheduled 1:1s with my designer and PM to share my AI workflow, starting a new "designer + engineer pairing" ritual to uplift the entire team's skills.
- **I embody XP and a growth mindset:** I consistently apply XP principles in both my technical and team-based work. This includes:
   - Using rigorous TDD, and applying its principles to AI, to ensure stability on logically complex features.
   - Fully embracing core XP practices like pair programming, which I've appreciated on the Polaris team.
   - Actively working to improve our team rituals, whether that's productively challenging a design flow or experimentally proposing a new, useful one (like designer-engineer pairing).
- **I'm an active partner in our team's health:** When the MOSS team hit some friction and got internal feedback on our design flow, I didn't shy away from the discussion. I was an active participant in working through it productively by having the difficult conversations necessary, with the goal of getting us back on track and making sure everyone on the team felt valued and confident in our way of working.
Overall, I am a teammate who notes problems, solves them efficiently, and proactively shares what I've learned to make the entire team more effective at shipping outcomes.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:** I plan to start collaborating more intentionally across teams. By sharing context and finding alignment with other teams, I can help us identify larger, cross-cutting opportunities and contribute more directly to Rise8's strategic outcome goals and culture.
**Stop:** I plan to stop shying away from providing immediate, in-the-moment feedback. I recognize that direct and kind feedback is crucial for our team's health and velocity, and I'm committing to having those constructive conversations when they're most relevant, even when difficult.
**Keep:** I plan to keep my focus on pair programming and continuous knowledge sharing. This is the most effective way to eliminate & prevent knowledge silos, improve quality of outcomes, and uplift the skills of the entire team, and I will continue to champion these XP practices.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> In response to direct user feedback on the MOSS app, I investigated and resolved a major performance bottleneck by reducing the app's bundle size by ~70% and average API call size by ~80%. This cut the first meaningful paint time from 3.4 seconds down to 0.4 seconds, which in turn fostered trust with our users and led to a more complete adoption of the application, ensuring the mission value we were building was not undermined by a poor user experience.




Our team pioneered and scaled the integration of AI within our XP framework, aligning with Rise8's stance on being ahead of the game with using AI to boost productivity. I helped drive this by first incorporating it into my own TDD workflow for refactoring complex logic, which improved our code's stability. I then worked to scale this by proactively scheduling 1:1s with our designer and PM on Polaris, helping them integrate AI into their own daily workflows. This collaboration is evolving into sort of a “designer + engineer pairing" ritual and helped uplift the entire team's skills and velocity.




I was a key driver in delivering high-value outcomes for the 15th SPSS, which was part of a highly productive period where our MOSS team delivered 12 distinct outcomes in production from January to July. This contribution was a massive driver of Rise8's mission, accounting for nearly one-third (31.6%) of the entire company's 38 outcomes for the first half of the year. My primary focus this year was delivering the Daily Status Report (DSR) and shift schedule integration. I worked closely with users, including an off-site visit, to solve one of their biggest pain points by integrating their convoluted, manual data-entry process directly into the MOSS application. This specific outcome saved operators time, reduced errors, and directly improved mission capabilities, while also enabling data collection for a stakeholder dashboard that will help leadership prioritize Rise8 for future contracts.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Drew. He joined us mid-project and picked up our complex architecture incredibly fast. He had to learn Angular at the same time but still asked the right questions to really understand the system. He quickly went from following along to driving our pairing sessions, which allowed him to contribute value almost immediately. He is also very proactive; he often spots bugs, creates tickets for them, and helps us fix them before they ever reach production.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Being more present in group meetings. I know it can feel efficient to clear out small tasks during meetings, but it would be great to have your full focus during those meetings. Following the thread of the conversation helps you catch the "why" behind decisions, and hearing what your take on things is helps us understand where you're coming from.




Keep: Your willingness to adapt. It makes pairing and iterating with you really easy and productive because you take feedback so well. That’s a huge asset to the team.




Keep: I’ve noticed lately that you’re asking more questions rather than asserting knowledge. This is awesome; it builds trust and helps us move faster.




Stop: Feeling the need to "prove" your contributions. I’ve noticed you doing this less lately, and you can totally let this go. We all see the value you're adding.

**Comment**:
> Drew has been a wonderful teammate on both MOSS and Narrowband. He  brings a calm, thoughtful presence and a deep technical understanding that grounds our conversations in reality, especially when working with SAR data.




 Drew played a key role in helping deliver the **12 approved MOSS outcomes** this year, contributing to their implementation, refinement, and success. His work directly supported outcomes like health monitoring, audit logging, auto-populated DSR logs, and incident reporting—each of which improved mission readiness and reduced operator burden.




Beyond delivery, Drew naturally steps into leadership. He took initiative in educating product and design on new tech tooling, helping us understand what’s feasible and how the system behaves. Pairing with Drew is always a pleasant and productive experience. He creates an easy, low-friction environment that helps the entire team work more effectively. He also implemented metric collection on the MOSS contract, which became a major unlock, and bringing that same rigor into Narrowband will be incredibly valuable.




I’d encourage Drew to continue leaning into his leadership qualities and to voice his perspective even more during strategic conversations. Overall, Drew is a natural leader, a strong engineer, and a great teammate to work with.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
– Leaning more into his leadership strengths by vocalizing to high-level prioritization, technical direction, and strategic decision discussions.
– Bringing the same data-driven metric collection approach used on MOSS into the Narrowband contract.




**Keep:**
– Bringing a grounding, technically thorough understanding to implementation conversations.
– Maintaining his calm, positive, and collaborative presence across both teams.
– Pairing frequently and creating a smooth, easy environment for feedback and development.
– Sharing insights on tooling, tech choices, and system mechanics in a way that helps product and design learn quickly.
– Contributing to high-quality, high-impact outcomes just as he did across all 12 MOSS outcomes.
– Continuing to guide the team on tooling and system behaviors, especially for newer product members.

Since he joined, team interactions have become more engaging, with more dialogue and thoughtful responses in meetings, small shifts that have meaningfully improved the team’s collaboration and energy. Drew is inviting, approachable, and an excellent collaborator; for example, he generously extends his AI practice time and provides technical mentoring to PM/Design. I would love to be on the same team with Drew again.

> Although my time working with Drew has been limited due to his recent start on the project, he has already established himself as a dependable and hardworking teammate who consistently executes on tasks.




Drew possesses a unique and valuable skill set in pair programming. While he is often quiet, he does a lot of background research - constantly looking up relevant APIs, researching error messages, and reproducing buggy behaviors. He pulls his weight effectively and has demonstrated an ability to learn new concepts rapidly, becoming productive very early in his time on the team. I look forward to seeing his continued growth at Rise8!

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing:**
- Keep functioning as a high-utility "background processor" during pairing. Your ability to parallel-process (researching APIs, hunting down error messages, reproducing bugs) while your partner drives is a massive asset to the team's velocity.
- Keep following up with the team, learning the domain, and participating in context sharing. Your ability to absorb context and contribute code during pairing and thoughts during team meetings immediately is helpful.
**Stop Doing:**
- Stop initiating background work silently - While you are doing valuable work, your partner can sometimes feel like they are working alone if they don't know what you are looking at.
**Start Doing:**
- Start providing architectural feedback in PRs/pairing sessions. I want to see you asking questions about design patterns, testability, and long-term maintainability - even if it's just a thought exercise.
- Start volunteering to lead certain epics - ask early to pair up with the design/pm team to get early preview of what's coming up next, and how we might tackle it. Or volunteer to take on a technical tasks that might make you uncomfortable.
- Start trying to innovate how we do work as a team - find pain points that are brought up in retro, and do some research online (podcasts, blogs, gemini/chatgpt) for solutions. Bring those ideas to the team, and see if we can measure results.
