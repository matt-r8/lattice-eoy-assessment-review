Each of us brings our own experiences, knowledge, wisdom, expertise, perspective, and personality to the team which makes us an effective, cohesive unit that gets on well with each other.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I have prior experience in working at a company that practiced a very similar flavor of agile and XP which has helped becoming an effective contributor my specific the team and the greater Forge concern.  That being said, I know there's always room for improvement, hence my not giving myself a top rating in any categories.  I feel like I am growing into becoming a better riser.  One area I can call out, is bias for action.  Being new to the company, I think there were times that I was hesitant because I was still feeling the culture out (I guess you can say).  I think in the future, I'll have more confidence in taking these opportunities for action.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Built a test app based on NOVA's dependencies and deploying to the platform in an effort to have a model that we can continually use to test the platform prior to NOVA being deployed.  Hopefully leading to a successful, streamlined onboarding for our first client in order to prove the value that FORGE provides
- Helped the Enablement find its place and responsibilities in the larger FORGE team and to find ways to best work with other Rise8 teams to accomplish the common goal of delivering a quality platform for out client.
- Anchored my initial team (automation) in the early stages of FORGE and started to explore early opportunities for automation and eventually helped in forming the opinion that the team was quite not structured correctly, which eventually lead to it being assumed into the Enablement team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **START:** Sharing your opinions more freely in discussions. You've got good instincts and thoughtful perspectives, but sometimes you hold back. The team would benefit from hearing what you think more often.
**STOP:** Sometimes it can be hard to follow what you're saying when talking through complex concepts.I think sometimes the important bits get buried in detail, which makes makes it hard to know what's important and what's just you working through it in real time.
**CONTINUE:** Being the optimistic, helpful person you are. You're always willing to jump in when someone needs help, and your positive attitude when we're facing problems honestly makes everything feel more manageable. The team is better because you're on it.

**Comment**:
> Start focusing on communication style. Take a pause to consider what you want to say and deliver it with confidence. If the words can't come out the way you want, check with clarification from others. Ex, "Do you get where I'm going with this?" or "Does that make sense or should I try to rephrase?"




I don't have a good stop recommendation.




Keep taking initiative on tasks and sharing out information that is learned.
