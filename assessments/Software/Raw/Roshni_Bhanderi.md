**Comment**:
> **1. Integrated AI Tools to Improve Engineering Efficiency**
I incorporated Claude into my workflow to increase test coverage, refactor code, and automate routine tasks such as moving data between environments. This supports the company’s AI initiative by improving speed, consistency, and developer productivity.
**2. Delivered Key Features Despite Platform Constraints**
I developed solutions to work around several Foundry limitations, including migrating records between ontology objects and addressing inconsistencies between lower and upper environments. I also resolved issues with Marketplace installations and Workshop function behavior. These efforts enabled continued product delivery in areas where out‑of‑the‑box platform support was limited.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## Start: Embrace Elevated Leadership
You possess a rare and innate leadership aptitude that sets you apart. I believe your next step should be to fully embrace and actively seek out more expansive leadership roles. Your ability to guide any team is founded on three pillars: your deep and highly relevant industry knowledge, your exceptional interpersonal and social intelligence which fosters strong team cohesion, and an unwavering drive that ensures projects are not just completed, but executed with excellence and efficiency. You are a natural leader, and teams thrive under your direction.




## Stop: Prioritize Sustainable Pace Over Sheer Effort
While your dedication and work ethic are truly remarkable, there is a noticeable tendency to over-extend yourself, potentially leading to burnout. You currently do an admirable job of balancing your commitments, but I encourage you to set more robust boundaries. It would be beneficial to consciously stop the cycle of tackling difficult challenges late in the day or pushing through demanding tasks regardless of unrealistic customer deadlines. 




## Keep: Cultivating Innovative Expertise
I am consistently impressed by your proactive and genuine interest in continuous learning. Specifically, your recent deep dive into the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is an exciting and valuable development. I strongly believe that your intellectual curiosity and analytical skills would make you an exceptional asset. Please continue to pursue this interest, and I encourage you to actively volunteer or seek involvement in any Rise8 project focused on developing or integrating AI tools.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Roshni because she is a highly capable and dependable engineer whose technical contributions have been essential to the success of the team. For much of the year, she was the only engineer with access to the classified environment, and she handled that responsibility with consistency and accuracy. Her deep understanding of the OSIT product and the classified setup played a critical role in the successful COMET 2.0 integration, and she regularly provides the information and context needed for other engineers to upskill and execute effectively.




Roshni has repeatedly demonstrated strong technical competence, reliability, and the ability to deliver in high-responsibility situations. Her knowledge and steady execution make her an invaluable asset to the team, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with her again.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Speaking up more during engineering-heavy discussions.** Her technical expertise is significant, and the team benefits when she shares her knowledge proactively.
- **Providing more actionable, constructive feedback.** As a senior engineer, offering clear feedback will help strengthen team skills and promote a more open communication environment.
- **Allowing junior engineers to drive more during pairing sessions.** Creating intentional space for others to lead will help them build confidence and expand their capabilities.
- **Engaging in side projects to maintain and grow her skills.** This ensures she stays aligned with her long-term technical goals and continues to strengthen areas she may not use daily on the current project.
### 
**STOP / REDUCE**
- **Taking the lead by default during pairing.** While she often knows the correct approach quickly, letting others take the keyboard more often will accelerate their development.
### 
**KEEP DOING**
- **Leveraging her expertise in the classified environment.** Her knowledge remains a key asset for the team, especially when bridging gaps between environments.
- **Providing context and technical guidance when needed.** This support has helped other engineers ramp up more quickly and deliver more effectively.
- **Delivering consistently reliable technical work.** Her steady execution was central to the COMET 2.0 integration and continues to be valuable to the project.
- **Maintaining her strong understanding of OSIT and the project ecosystem.** Her depth of knowledge in these areas continues to be essential to team operations and project success.

**Comment**:
> Roshni is a miracle worker. Over the course of this contract, we have been put in tough spots with deadlines or handling customer interactions... They have been challenging. However, I have no doubt in my mind that without Roshni, the CFC contract would not be in as good of a spot as it is today. Through all the...stuff with this contract, Roshni has kept her head high and consistently delivered efficiently. She slows down to explain technicals with others and is a great teammate to have overall. She is open to feedback and is not afraid to accept blame if and improve.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> Overall I think Roshni should keep doing what she is doing. 
One thing I would like her to start is to be more of a leader with the rest of the team. Although she is not the anchor, Roshni has alot (if not the most) technical context on this contract. I want to see her use that knowledge more to influence and teach others.

**Comment**:
> I have limited experience working with Roshni because she's been needed so much on SIPR work, but it's clear that she's a leading example of what engineers should aim to become. She's exceptionally capable in Warp Core and has proven to be a lynchpin member of the team. She's inquisitive when figuring things out and has a strong work ethic to see things through. She often takes initiative and gets shit done.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- I don't know how reasonable this is, given the SIPR workload, but Roshni can take initiative to pair with other team members to help spread the knowledge. I'm sure she has a lot of knowledge on good ways to do things, but it's only been able to surface during meetings or Slack conversations so far
- Somewhat similarly, Roshni can give feedback when appropriate. I haven't received any feedback from her and I know I have things to work on - some things as mundane as being a more engaging speaker and working on my ums / ahs / filler words.
- Roshni can consider turning her webcam on from time to time. My webcam usage varies, and tends to be off more than it's on, but it allows "conversation" even while muted with facial expressions and body language. Our clothing, home decor, and random background items can spark the water cooler conversations that we usually miss out on since we're remote. I've personally liked having video on for stand up and usually having it off the rest of the day.
Stop
- I don't have anything Roshni should stop doing at this time
Keep doing
- Being a key person responsible for a ton of the success we've had in producing OSIT and ODIE

> Roshni is one of the most talented developers on the team with some of the most experience in warpcore. She is able to tackle some of the most difficult stories and get them done quickly. She also utilizes her SIPR access to consistently ship outcomes into prod, and is willing to explain what she is doing when asked questions on it.

**Comment**:
> Roshni is a very talented developer which makes tackling harder stories easier to do with her as a paired programmer, and once I get the ball rolling you are easy to talk to and pair with. However, I have also noticed it can be difficult to talk to you at times which can make approaching you for help hard to do at times. It also can be difficult to follow you at times when you are moving so fast (as time goes on I anticipate that I will improve at keeping up).

**Comment**:
> I acknowledge the significant burden you carried on this project due to being the sole team member with SIPR access for about five months. Now that Lambo, Danny, Sagar, Cory, and Kyle have obtained access, I hope your workload and expectations have become more manageable.




Regardless if you end up on an other project or remain on SpOC, the substantial domain expertise you've accumulated, in Foundry/Warpcore, Marketplaces, and more, is invaluable. 
I encourage you to transform those challenges and learnings into actionable insights for other Risers. Thinking back, what key advice or strategy would you implement differently now?

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Just FYI: This feedback should have been shared with you earlier and more often. that’s my bad.




**Start** proactively collaborating with others or on your own sharing your specialized learnings and methods across the OSIT app, Warpcore, and the Marketplace. While you share valuable knowledge when prompted, it's currently hit-or-miss. Given your unique responsibility and exposure to the SIPR process, we would benefit if you to step up as a knowledge leader, consistently enabling the team with your insights.




**Avoid/Stop** Communication that creates the impression that all teammates share your level of technical understanding, especially with non-engineers. This assumption can lead to prolonged follow-up questions or require excessive effort to understand necessary details about the work in progress or future plans. I recommend being more conscious of your audience, their level of understanding, and expertise. By proactively asking clarifying questions, you can adjust your responses to ensure optimal clarity and proactive communication when discussing technical topics.




**Keep** creating and contributing to documentation that helps the team understand the inner workings of complex platforms like Foundry and Warpcore. This commitment to knowledge transfer is incredibly valuable. Additionally, please continue keeping up open communications on Slack; it's been great seeing and hearing more from you as you share updates and insights with the team.
