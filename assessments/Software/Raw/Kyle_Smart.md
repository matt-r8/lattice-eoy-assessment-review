**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Although I have only been at Rise8 for about two months, I am getting the hang of things on my team and at the company. I am excited to start using my knowledge to help further along the application I work on and push to prod more often and with higher quality results.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I want to start driving more and getting hands on with the application as well as working directly with the customer and on the production environment to further my comfort and skills with the application. I also plan to further my knowledge base by starting a pro developer course to expand my knowledge further into palantir, AWS, and Kubernetes.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Unfortunately I have not have a ton of time to get a ton of accomplishments under my belt here, but I am proud of the following:
1) Was able to quickly meet with the customer in person and establish a means to see them on a consistent basis and acquire access to the work environment they are in at Peterson Space Force Base. This impact will be shown in the fact that the users can put a face to a project/development team and if they have an urgent concern I can address it asap with the customer on prod. 
2) Was able to quickly get a good handle on how Palantir and worpcore work and begin to add value to the OSIT application and further drive development for the application while providing real value to the customer. This impact will be shown with the stories and tasks I complete within the application and with my team as I take on more and more tasks to help the other devs with the work load.
3) Quickly got access to a reliable way to get on the SIPR network so that I can contribute directly on production when needed for the team. The impact here is felt by the team and client as before I got access, only two devs had access before, limiting how often the team could reach onto prod to verify bugs and address customer concerns. With myself getting access, I can assist the team by going onto prod and be another dev to access and work on prod directly.

**Comment**:
> Kyle is new to the team and probably needs more time to display his commitment to these values, since the uncomfortable situations don't typically arise right away. That said, I'm confident he has the ability and desire to be a role model for Rise8. I recently took him aside for a feedback session where I shared a couple possible areas of improvement, and Kyle was extremely receptive and enthusiastic about the experience. His reactions increased my confidence in working with him.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- Consider turning your webcam on from time to time. My webcam usage varies, and tends to be off more than it's on, but it allows "conversation" even while muted with facial expressions and body language. Your clothing, home decor, and random background items can spark the water cooler conversations that we usually miss out on since we're remote. I've personally like having video on for stand up and usually having it off the rest of the day.
- Bragging / talking about the things you've done to get up to speed with Warp Core. I remember the couple of learning projects Cory built, and I know Kyle also worked on self-paced learning projects, but I don't remember being impressed with the creativity or scope of what he worked on.
- Speaking up more. I hear some questions or push back from Kyle, but I feel like a senior engineer on a new platform would be more aggressive about understanding it. I haven't received any feedback from Kyle on things I can improve on, of which I can name a few, but I know he's new and Rise8 is more intentional about feedback than most companies.
Stop
- I've noticed Kyle will pause or use filler words while putting his thoughts together. I also have to work on this - I've found keeping a GDoc journal of my activities each day has helped me organize my thoughts before the next day's stand up, and I can quickly and succinctly give my update. I also try to gather my thoughts when formulating an answer by saying "I got you, I'll take a minute to think about this" if I feel I need a longer pause. 
Keep doing
- Being curious and persistent in the face of unclear next steps. Kyle's been great at speaking his thoughts when driving our pairing sessions

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Kyle because, even as a newer member of the team, he has quickly demonstrated reliability, capability, and a collaborative, positive attitude that makes him a pleasure to work with. He approaches his work with focus and consistency, completes tasks effectively, and actively seeks out professional development opportunities to expand his skills.




Kyle shows strong potential to take on more ownership of tasks and contribute at a higher level. He is also beginning to develop the ability to provide constructive feedback to teammates, which will strengthen team communication and collaboration over time. His combination of technical growth, willingness to learn, and steady, positive presence on the team makes him a valuable contributor, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Proactively taking on more ownership of tasks.** As a newer member of the team, seeking opportunities to drive small features or components will help Kyle gain confidence and accelerate his growth.
- **Continuing to engage in professional development opportunities.** Actively applying new skills or techniques learned will strengthen his contributions and help him grow into more complex responsibilities.
- **Providing constructive feedback to teammates.** Sharing insights or observations will help Kyle strengthen his communication skills and contribute to a more open, collaborative team environment.
### 
**STOP**
- **Waiting for direction on tasks that he can take initiative on.** Kyle is capable of contributing more autonomously, and stepping up sooner on tasks he can drive will help him build confidence and increase his impact.
### 
**KEEP DOING**
- **Maintaining his positive attitude and collaborative approach.** Kyle’s upbeat mindset makes him a pleasure to work with and contributes to a supportive team environment.
- **Being reliable and consistent in completing assigned tasks.** His dependability ensures that the team can count on him to help deliver outcomes.
- **Seeking out learning opportunities.** His proactive approach to professional growth will continue to benefit both him and the team.
