### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Start: Being more involved in team communication/decisions, trying to voice ideas and opinions more and have a bigger impact on my projects outside of just doing the work.
- Stop: Keeping concerns to myself, being more open and communicate risks as I see them rather than trying to solve them behind the scenes.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Delivering G8way to Space Force. Despite the contract not being extended/continued I believe we showed Space Force that there are significant improvements that can be made to current processes and hopefully helped open a door for Rise8 to work within Space Force more in the future.
2. Delivering GR8 (TAK App) in code challenge. It was a difficult challenge and I believe we delivered an amazing prototype despite numerous technical issues.
3. Integrating AI into my development workflow. This is a smaller accomplishment than the other 2 and is still ongoing but beginning to use AI as a "pair" has already saved me a ton of time completing smaller coding tasks and helped me brainstorm solutions to complex problems.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> **Yes — absolutely!**
They bring a rare combination of deep technical capability, broad full-stack proficiency, and consistent ownership over whatever problem they take on. Throughout the year, we partnered closely on both the internal website and the WinTak prototype, and they demonstrated reliability and impact at every stage. Their ability to move fluidly between frontend, backend, and systems-level complexity was instrumental to the success of both projects.
On WinTak in particular, they were the only other engineer on the effort and carried significant portions of the technical workload. Their contributions directly shaped the quality of the prototype and played a major role in its success with the customer. They’re the kind of teammate you want on high-ambiguity, high-stakes work — steady, thoughtful, and technically fearless.
Their presence raises the baseline of the team, I would rehire them any day.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- **Start proactively surfacing updates earlier in the development cycle.** Their work is strong and reliable; sharing progress, risks, and thought processes more frequently will give the team better visibility and help others align around their decisions.
### **Keep**
- **Keep bringing exceptional technical depth to the work.** Their ability to solve complex problems across the stack is a major asset to the organization.
- **Keep taking ownership of difficult or ambiguous tasks.** They lean into complexity rather than avoid it, which makes them incredibly dependable in high-stakes situations.
- **Keep being a calm, reliable presence on fast-paced or mission-critical projects.** Their composure and care positively influence team culture and delivery quality.

**Comment**:
> Thomas was always willing to put in the hours on hard problems to get them fixed. I didn't always agree with the approach, but he did produce outcomes and I can't deny that. I would work with him again and even agreed to once when an opportunity came across that didn't come to fruition.

I don't have a good stop recommendation.




Keep improving soft skills like feedback and communication with juniors and peers.

Because our workflows haven't overlapped significantly in the last four months, I am concerned that my input wouldn't provide the depth that they deserve for their year-end assessment. To ensure their evaluation is based on recent data, I believe it is best for me to decline this specific review so that feedback can be prioritized from colleagues who have collaborated with them more closely during this period.

> It’s difficult to give full recommendations for the coming year since my interactions with him were brief, but based on what I saw, I would encourage him to keep bringing forward his questions, especially the challenges the rest of the team might not notice. I’d also recommend that he continue looking ahead at the work with an eye toward mitigating risks. He was consistently easy to work with, especially in the engineer–designer dynamic, and he made it comfortable to ask questions. I hope he continues that approach moving forward.

> I have limited experience with Thomas directly, as I primarily worked with Kevan as the engineer anchor on the TAK 8-week project. So I would leave it to his engineer peers to evaluate his performance with the actual dev tasks. My responses are based on meeting interactions and pairing for design review only.




In that experience, our interactions were good, kind, and positive. It was clear and easy to work with him.
