**Comment**:
> Kevan's technical prowess and hard work and get it done work ethic is second to none!




Kevan cares deeply about doing the right thing for the client and Rise8.




SpOC OSIT launch would have failed without him and TAK wouldn't have built such a great app. He's already digging in and running fast with Ventures.




Areas of Growth
Sometimes Kevan says, "I don't care how you do it", when he does in fact care.  I think the solution here is keep caring just be honest with yourself and those around you about what you actually care about.




"Perfect is the enemy of good" - Voltaire.
 "Would you rather be right or successful?"
This is one I still struggle with, and I think Kevan does too. I think there are some things you can let go of and still see success.  Very rarely is there an ideal situation, but to acknowledge it, mitigate it, and move on.




The to items above I think create some friction for Kevan and people not accustomed to the directness and passion.  I know that Kevan has been passing stuff by me and Gemini for tone to help ensure his true intent is heard.




Reflecting, maybe I pushed back on this or didn't act fast enough, but I think we could have avoided the SpOC relational problems if we had moved faster to swap personnel.  Push me harder next time if I was the problem, or suggest a personnel change sooner.  You may have, but I know we waffled a bit too.  You really did advocate for the team to leadership, even though some of the relations soured. I think would make it easier for me would be understanding when you're just frustrated and when you want to replace someone.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep pushing hard and pushing us to technical excellence.
Keep checking your tone so you ensure you're intent is heard.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Kevan is a high-value member of the Rise8 team. He has work ethic, tenacity, dedication to the mission that position him as a team leader on any team that he is part of. He leads with strong opinions that often prove themselves, building confidence with customers at any seniority level.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: I have seen Kevan excel at execution and taking instruction/guidance and running with it. With his skills I believe he can begin to own strategic shaping in partnership with our customers -- a behavior that I hope his role as a Delivery Lead will encourage.
Stop: In his capacity as a Delivery Lead it will be even more important to understand how to craft feedback and collaborative critique so that it is received positively and beneficially. In the past, Kevan has had a tendency to act himself rather than coach others through. I have experienced Kevan's coaching and have personally found it kind, but the delivery doesn't always land that way with others. In short, I suggest slowing down and building patience for behavioral change.

**Comment**:
> Start thinking about how to evolve the Rise8 delivery process using AI. This could help with future service offerings and set you up as a leader in certain types of projects (like TAK)
Stop - Not really a "stop", but I’ve noticed that when someone makes a mistake, your reaction can jump to the extreme, which can create more fear or urgency than the situation calls for. Nothing to "stop" at this point but keep that in mind as a Deliver Lead going forward.
Keep getting feedback on how to continuously improve, especially as you become a leader within your new role as a DL

**Comment**:
> I have really enjoyed collaborating with Kevan as a DPL and look forward to working with him as a delivery lead.  He has a very pragmatic, results-oriented take on any given situation.  Not sure, but he might be allergic to ineffective or broken processes. He's willing to challenge existing patterns and processes to try a better way, he has constructive feedback, and he understands and deconstructs the way team dynamics impact the project.
