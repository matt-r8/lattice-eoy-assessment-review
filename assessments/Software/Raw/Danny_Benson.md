**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would be an enthusiastic rehire because of my proven ability to drive both technical excellence and team cohesion in challenging environments. Placed on a contract with significant challenges, I successfully created a team culture where feedback and communication are expected and encouraged, strengthening collaboration across engineering, product, and design disciplines.




As the anchor of the team, I played a central role in turning around a contract plagued by morale, communication gaps, and lack of stakeholder confidence. I proactively identified and addressed issues across multiple disciplines, partnered with the portfolio engineering lead to create process diagrams and documentation, and bridged the communication gap between engineers, product team members, stakeholders, and third-party vendors. My efforts repaired trust with stakeholders, navigated difficult personalities, and fostered a collaborative, high-performing environment.




Through effective communication, mentorship, and strategic oversight, I consistently raised the performance of the team and ensured successful outcomes. My combination of technical skill, leadership, and cross-disciplinary influence makes me a highly effective contributor, and I would be welcomed back enthusiastically to this team.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Danny had a tall order when joining the OSIT team as its first anchor. He had to navigate through lots of past “baggage” from fractured team and customer relationships. Despite this he rolled up his sleeves and was an immediate contributor and leader with Product Managers, Designers and Engineers. Not saying it was easy or simple. He listened, he advised but most importantly he took action to help us improve. He is the walking Rise8 value for “be bold”.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Stop/Avoid** using chats (Slack or Teams) for delivering complex or dense feedback. While your directness is valuable (and works well in meetings!), written format can accidentally strip away necessary context and tone. Instead, grab some time on the calendar or just call us. Your 1:1 voice or video call is far more effective and cuts through the assumptions and misunderstandings.




**Keep** making yourself readily available to both give and receive feedback. It's often difficult to maintain this consistency, but you have been an exception. While your passion sometimes shows, you are always diligent in ensuring your feedback is ultimately framed kindly, fairly, and actionably. Continue to prioritize this open line of communication.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Danny because he immediately elevated the team across multiple dimensions. He stepped in and worked fluidly across disciplines, helping bring order, clarity, and stronger execution practices to the team. Danny provides direct but caring feedback, and he consistently shows up not just as an engineering lead but as a true leader for the entire group.




I already see Danny operating at a level above senior. His influence, judgment, and ability to guide others align more closely with a staff-level engineer. Beyond his technical leadership, he brings kindness, empathy, fun, and a strong work ethic that make him an invaluable teammate. Danny makes the team better in every way, and his presence raises the bar for everyone around him.

### Question 12

- Taking more ownership of artifact creation, such as technical diagrams and product-facing documentation, and leaning even further into presenting them!
## **Stop Doing**
- Phrasing questions or concerns in ways that can unintentionally come across as challenging someone’s competence. Instead, frame them with the curiosity and collaborative intent that you genuinely have.
## **Keep Doing**
- Maintaining strong opinions, high standards, and accountability across disciplines.
- Continuing to elevate the entire team through leadership, thoughtful feedback, and a willingness to improve processes and execution.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Increasing Technical Decision Engagement
As our technical anchor, I recommend you significantly increase your direct involvement in engineering decision-making. Given your unique perspective from interfacing directly with customers, your technical input is vital for bridging the divide between customer needs and the technical implementation roadmap. Your participation will help guide the engineering team toward solutions that are not only architecturally sound but also optimally aligned with high-level strategic goals, maximizing the impact of our development efforts. You already do this, but getting even more involved is great for the engineering team.




Stop: Over-Reliance on Customer Validation for Internal Work
To accelerate our internal velocity, I advise that we collectively reduce our dependency on continuous customer validation for advancing necessary internal development efforts. While customer feedback is essential for external features, initiatives focused on technical debt, infrastructure, or performance improvements that guarantee substantial long-term operational wins should be prioritized and executed based on internal strategic merit, rather than waiting for external approval. Your influence can help champion this proactive investment strategy.




Keep: Maintaining Candid Team Communication
Please continue providing your consistently honest and unfiltered input in all team discussions. This raw candor is a unique and valuable strength that acts as a vital catalyst for productive debate and transparent communication. By openly raising crucial, sometimes challenging, points, you ensure the team considers all angles, leading to better-informed strategic alignment and ultimately resulting in higher-quality collective decisions.

He communicates kindly and is thoughtful and reflective when he might not be the most experience or knowledgable on a topic or situation.




After writing that out, the only thing I can maybe offer as a "start doing" is leading by example with pro dev. He's done a great job becoming familiar with Warp Core after joining the team recently, but I don't have any examples of pro dev he's spoken about.

> Unfortunately I can't really say too much here as I have only had minimal interaction with you so I can't say for sure what you do well or poorly other than that I really like the biweekly 1:1s and they should be continued, it really helps with getting a better feeling on being a member of the team.
