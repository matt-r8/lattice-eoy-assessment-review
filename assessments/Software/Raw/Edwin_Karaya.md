**No Unnecessary Rules: I am very comfortable in a high agency environment, and don’t seek or try to implement unnecessary rules.**

**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would rehire me because I deliver outcomes, take ownership of hard problems, and consistently help others succeed. I raise the technical bar, share knowledge openly, and contribute positively to team culture.
This year I delivered outcomes on Nimbus and EM&C, contributed significantly to a major ATAK proposal, and introduced a compliant AI assisted workflow that helped other engineers work more effectively. I show up for the mission, the users, and my team every day.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- Formalizing and sharing AI assisted engineering patterns (Claude in container workflows, testing guidance, compliance considerations).
- Increasing cross team architectural mentorship and helping shape reusable patterns across the client.
- Pushing more strongly for workflow simplification on EM&C and across other teams.
### **Stop**
- Spending unnecessary time compensating for flawed legacy patterns instead of steering conversations toward sustainable improvements.
- Waiting too long to raise technical risks or concerns.
### **Keep**
- Leveraging AI responsibly to accelerate development and sharing that capability with others.
- Driving measurable production outcomes across missions.
- Taking ownership of hard problems and delivering through ambiguity.
- Sharing knowledge through lightning talks, pairing, and cross-team collaboration.
- Bringing clarity and structure to complex or legacy codebases.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **1. Nimbus**
I contributed to a major redesign of Nimbus’s core architecture to support dynamic and extensible weather criteria. I helped make Nimbus publicly accessible, resulting in 300+ users in the first month and eliminating legacy alerting delays. This improved situational awareness and supported safer, more frequent launches.
### **2. EM&C Mission Workup**
On a legacy Angular system, I delivered improvements that produced immediate impact for planners:
- 50% faster triage
- 100% removal of re-review
- 50% faster acceptance time
These changes freed planners to focus on higher-priority mission work and improved workflow efficiency.
### **3. ATAK Proposal Engineering Contribution**
I performed deep technical analysis of the ATAK codebase and authored the engineering section of Rise8’s submission for a $100M / 5-year SOFMC contract. Our submission placed in the top five. This work demonstrated strong technical communication, architecture reasoning, and cross-team contribution.
### **4. AI Adoption**
I adopted the Claude in container workflow and became one of the early engineers to use it in day to day delivery. I shared how to use it effectively with teammates and engineers across the mission, helping them understand how to pair with AI safely and productively. This contributed to healthier real-world discussions about how AI assisted development fits into our workflows, including how practices like TDD evolve alongside AI coding assistants.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> You have been a critical additional to the team this cycle, leveraging your tenure to expertly guide our newer engineering team in adopting not just Rise8 practices and core values, but the best engineering practices overall. Your push in integrating AI (Claude) into our workflow was crucial to our success in completing the complex ARA form from discovery to production in just 4 weeks. Your technical depth is already shaping future work; the Kahless team requested your input on Playwright for establishing automated testing pattern (fingers crossed that will be implemented). I appreciate your occasional chat and sharing in our Slack, as they help our team opens up and feel safe.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
I hope you get a chance to start providing more technical architectural and design work that showcases your technical knowledge. I know you still have a lot in your tank but given the lack of context and our team is relatively new to the program, it will take time.
Going to at least one PI planning :)




**Keep**
Being yourself and keep sharing things. I thoroughly enjoy your workout progress updates and cosplays
Pushing for more AI practices in our team to provide the best productivity we can achieve




**Stop**
Nothing really

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> In the short time I worked with Edwin, he consistently brought clarity to unclear requirements by asking insightful questions and communicating clearly across the team. He proactively offered help and was instrumental in unblocking others (myself included) during the sprint. His introduction and championing of the Claude AI container had a real, measurable impact on development speed and delivery. Would love to see continued growth by occasionally stepping away from AI tools to keep critical and creative thinking sharp. 




From what I observed, he’s performing near a Team Leader level. Overall, a solid contributor who made a noticeable difference during my time with the MW team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**: Try starting your implementation based on your own understanding before bringing in AI for optimization or feedback. This could help sharpen your intuition and strengthen problem solving muscles.
**Stop**: Nothing major to stop, perhaps just a light check on over-reliance on AI generated code.
**Keep**: Keep asking thoughtful, clarifying questions that bring clarity to vague requirements, it helps the whole team align faster. Keep leading the way on tools like Claude; your initiative meaningfully boosted sprint velocity, helped meet last minute changes, and made it easier for new engineers on the team (like me) to ramp up quickly.

**Comment**:
> Edwin is a very knowledgable engineer and has lots of experience. He has a sincere interest in helping others learn and often will take time to facilitate discussions of new concepts. He brings many ideas to the table and stays focused when there is a difficult problem to solve. There were occasional times where I was wanting to see Edwin have confidence in the strategy/mission and help drive a decision but seems to prefer to stay on the side of offering options. Edwin works really well with a confident anchor and PM, truly multiplying the engineering output. His ability to leverage LLMs for coding was also way ahead of the rest of the team very early on.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep:**
- Demonstrating great engineering practice: refactoring, pairing, just the right amount of up front design
- Facilitating valuable engineering practice or learning discussions
- Keeping a positive, can-do attitude




**Start:**
- Taking more ownership over the mission, help look for road bumps that others might see
- Make sure to keep an open mind for feedback and try not to think about your response before fully understanding the feedback. There were a couple times we had feedback session where I felt like you focused on making it clear that you knew about some behavior I noticed but I didn't feel as though you understood the way it affected me or the rest of the team. Listen for the part about how the behavior is affecting the person giving you feedback.
