**Comment**:
> My proven ability to translate technical complexity into tangible customer outcomes is exactly what the team needs. My expertise goes beyond writing clean code; it's rooted in architectural foresight, strategic planning, and cross-functional leadership to ensure features are not just shipped, but deliver maximum business value. Crucially, I bring specialized engineering knowledge, recently in AI/ML, which was indispensable for the success of the high-impact TAK challenge. My combined ability to drive product delivery and provide deep technical software guidance makes me an essential, immediate value-add to the organization.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Taking into the leadership role as the anchor of the CFC team. Provide guidance to the team, delegate when necessary, and ensure a smooth development lifecycle of our software deliveries through written documentation. This will help us achieve more outcomes in production. 




Stop**:** Diving deep into non-critical issues**.** Delegate or guide junior engineers to resolve common/minor bugs that don't require senior-level architectural insight. This frees up my time for strategic work.




Keep: Growing in software engineering and leadership skills. Keep up with the latest and greatest advancements that can help the engineers be more productive. Engage with the customers, portfolio team, and PMs to help facilitate the gap between engineers and leadership / customers.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Accomplishment: Create a path-to-production pipeline using Palantir's new marketplace. Investing into this new feature that Palantir provided has helped us accelerate our delivery metrics and ensure our customers receive the outcomes faster and more reliably.




Accomplishment: Use the limit capabilities of the Palantir foundry framework to solve multiple problems and requests by the customer. These features, despite their limitation, helped the customer overcome many problems and carved the path to making our tool the only status reporting tool in the force.




Accomplishment: Help the TAK team setup an AI training pipeline to improve our AI capabilities for the TAK challenge. The impact of this is yet to be known for its full extent, but our submission was deemed awardable by the government as of today.

**Comment**:
> Mases is one hell of a performer. He's new to Rise8 this year and has become an expert on the Warp Core platform in a short amount of time. If I didn't know differently, I'd assume he's been working with it his entire career. He's unfazed by obstacles or technical complexity and isn't easily deterred. I'm not at all surprised he was named anchor. His approach to work has made this an extremely easy review for me

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start
- Giving feedback. I haven't received any from Mases, and I personally know some areas I can improve, but I know it's his first year at Rise8 and we emphasize feedback more than most companies
- If he's not already, Mases could consider keeping a daily / weekly / etc journal of achievements to aid in bragging about himself in his self-review :-D
Stop
- I know it's not helpful, but I can't think of anything Mases should stop doing
Keep doing
- Being a great source of knowledge for the team. He thinks critically about vague situations and readily helps us work through understanding. He's always been happy to explain how things work and brings enthusiasm to pathfinding efforts

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Mases because he is a humble, highly skilled engineer who has consistently proven himself to be a cornerstone of the team. He is the person everyone turns to when troubleshooting complex issues—even without visibility into the classified environment—which speaks to his technical depth, problem-solving ability, and willingness to support others. His contributions were instrumental to the success of the COMET 2.0 integration, and he continually seeks to improve team efficiency, including driving meaningful automation around how we implement workshops with the OSIT product.




Beyond his technical strengths, Mases brings a calm, thoughtful presence and works well with every member of the team. His intellect, collaborative nature, and genuinely pleasant demeanor make him someone I would welcome the opportunity to work with again. He is a reliable, influential contributor whose impact is deeply felt across the project and the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Intentionally mentoring other engineers on the team.** As anchor, taking a more active role in guiding junior engineers will help elevate the whole team’s capabilities.
- **Creating more space for others to drive during pairing sessions.** Encouraging less experienced engineers to take the lead will help build their confidence and technical autonomy.
- **Providing more direct feedback.** Increasing the frequency and clarity of feedback will support a more open team culture and help teammates grow.




### **STOP / REDUCE**
- **Naturally taking the lead by default during pairing.** While his expertise often makes him the most efficient driver, stepping back at times will help others develop critical skills and ensure a balanced dynamic.




### **KEEP DOING**
- **Being the go-to troubleshooting resource.** His ability to help solve complex issues—even with limited visibility—continues to be invaluable.
- **Driving improvements to team efficiency.** His automation work and process enhancements consistently raise the team’s effectiveness.
- **Maintaining his humble, collaborative, and approachable demeanor.** His ability to work well with anyone strengthens the team and contributes to a positive working environment.
- **Delivering high-quality technical outcomes.** His contributions, including his critical role in COMET 2.0 integration, show his consistent ability to execute at a high level.

> I really like how easy it is to ask you questions on anything within Palantir, regardless how dumb the question is. I also like how you are able to explain very clearly what is happening and elaborate in a manor that makes sense to me. My largest piece of feedback is when you are working you move very quickly and at times it can be difficult to keep track of what is happening (I do anticipate this issue to alleviate as I get better at Palantir/warpcore).

He is a great communicator and does not give up on finding the best solution, even when things seem difficult (especially with palantir software).

He takes the time to understand the expected outcomes and impact our work is doing and he is quick to help others understand technical aspects of application. He is a overall great team player.

He collaborates well with people seeking more technical understanding. I don't think there's anything he needs to start or stop in particular. He is a solid engineer. He is now starting an anchor role and I firmly believe he will step up as a leader. He has the qualities of one. He is a good choice for the anchor position.
