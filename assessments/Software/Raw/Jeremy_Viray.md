**Comment**:
> My teammates would likely choose to work with me again because I approach challenges with curiosity, initiative, and a strong commitment to the team’s success. I’m intentional about asking good questions, absorbing feedback quickly, and applying what I learn in a way that moves the team forward. When pairing, I focus on shared understanding first, talking through ideas and tradeoffs before jumping into implementation. I’m also intentional about experimenting with different approaches so we can see the strengths and weaknesses of each option in real time.
I put effort into making sure everyone feels included and respected. I try to listen closely, pay attention to how people are feeling in team discussions, and bring steady, positive energy when things get tough. I’m always thinking about the impact of our work beyond the immediate task, how it affects customers, teammates, and the wider organization’s goals.
Ultimately, I try to contribute more than just technical output. I want to help build a team culture that’s collaborative, thoughtful, and aligned around meaningful outcomes.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> This year I want to start trying to take lead in more technical meetings even if I don't feel 100% confident in doing so. I also want to continue soliciting and offering feedback, but more often than I have been.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Getting the Nimbus application into production as well as getting outcomes in production to meet our brand promise. We were the first app on the RAD platform to get into production. Working closely with the portfolio team we helped define processes and iterate on the CI/CD pipeline to get it to where it's at today. Additionally, we were able to get working software into the hands of the weather squadron that positively impacts their mission.
2. Getting the Nimbus application to be public facing. This was a huge win for our team, getting our application to be public facing meant more people can access weather information. This not only led to user outcomes but also made our stakeholders very happy, as getting this weather information out to as many people as possible is high on their list of priorities.
3. Working on Nimbus from the ground up was one of the most valuable professional experiences of my career. Seeing the product evolve from inception to its current state taught me a great deal about product and design which are areas I had little exposure to before. Collaborating with my fellow developers has fundamentally shaped the way I think about software development. I’ve learned not just best practices like test-driven development, but also how to write cleaner, more maintainable code, and break down problems effectively.




Additionally this growth continued to escalate as I joined the Bifrost team. The realm of platform and CICD before this team was a cosmic void for me. Knowing zero about platform and CICD to being able to confidently write pipeline jobs and understand the architecture of what's needed from kubernetes, to runners, to security requirements. I feel like the amount of learning I've done in this past year is monumental and its made me a much more confident developer. The experience and lessons I’ve gained will undoubtedly carry over into future engagements

**Comment**:
> I think that one of your greatest strengths is having a good balance with AI. What I think that means is knowing when to use it, asking the right prompts at the level of understanding that you have, and being open with your pair on the whys behind your prompts. I've seen you level up really fast in terms of breadth and depth of knowledge by prompting, and you always keep note of what you've learned.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> We are both learning this platform space together, but I think that you could try to be more in tune with what stories are coming down the pipeline and how they relate to an epic. Be more open to story generation time, so you can have a better understanding at bridging the gap between stories and how they affect user outcome. 
I think you are already really good at understanding your current track of work and its next steps down to the detail, and completing stories without inflating their scope. 




If you get lost in ATO discussion/strategy meetings, can always jump into 1:1s or breakouts with other disciples to help understand what actually was discussed to get a clearer picture of where Bifrost stands from a non-technical point of view. It would help bridge the gap between in the weeds stories and the requirements/outcomes those stories are trying to fulfill.

**Comment**:
> Jeremy has been really valuable on the Bifrost team. Although he's coming from the app dev background, he found solid footing on a platform project. He's worked on some of the ADRs the team is using to define to vision for the project, and his work is solid and comprehensive.  He's using the processes the team has in place to contribute to the overall architecture of the platform.  I'd like to see him take that next step (defining the questions that need to be asked) and start to drive the overall direction of the team.

Continue: Learning as much as you can about platform development, bringing your own experience, expertise, and good ideas to the table, and helping define how Bifrost will come together.
