**Comment**:
> Lambo is the epitome of a trustworthy teammate. I feel like I can rely upon him to not only do the job that needs to get done, but he knows when to pull on the right resources and include others. He has a skill in balancing independent action with collaborative decision making.




He has greatly improved practices and delivery cadence for the CFC teams over the past few months through hands-on coaching, technical leadership, and emphasizing documentation. He is an indispensable member of the team.




Most noteworthy, he is an excellent coach and has created strengthened relationships between portfolio and product teams. He has phenomenal feedback skills that allow him to be an effective leader and coach by providing guidance, suggestion, and correction (to both Risers and customers) kindly.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Lambo because he is an exceptionally talented and highly proficient engineer whose technical skill and leadership have consistently elevated the teams he works with. Despite being placed on a contract with significant challenges, he quickly adapted, demonstrating remarkable aptitude for learning new technologies and a relentless commitment to the mission.




Lambo has been instrumental in turning around a complex project, navigating numerous hurdles, and increasing delivery to production. His mentorship, guidance, and creation of documentation for best practices and standard operating procedures have strengthened the product team and supported portfolio-level success. He also took initiative to secure access to classified environments and led critical engineering conversations with stakeholders. Lambo combines technical excellence, strategic impact, and an approachable yet authoritative demeanor, making him an invaluable asset. I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again without hesitation.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

### 
**STOP / REDUCE**
- **Taking on tasks that could be delegated.** While his skill allows him to handle complex work efficiently, stepping back from execution in some cases will allow team members to develop their capabilities.
### 
**KEEP DOING**
- **Delivering consistently high-quality technical work.** His contributions to complex projects and production delivery are exceptional.
- **Mentoring and guiding team members.** Creating best practices, SOPs, and providing one-on-one mentorship strengthens the team’s effectiveness.
- **Maintaining commitment, grit, and determination.** His focus and perseverance serve as an example for the team.
- **Leading critical engineering conversations and initiatives.** His technical expertise and authoritative approach ensure stakeholders and teams stay aligned and productive.
- **Adapting quickly to new technologies and challenges.** His ability to ramp up rapidly and take on complex, high-impact work makes him invaluable.

> Lambo hit the ground running on a team that had a lot of baggage and also on a new domain (Palantir/Warpcore) within a few weeks he had earn the trust and respect from the customer and our team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start** proactively identifying the best opportunities and methods for involving the Product Manager in early technical and feasibility strategic planning. With two Product Managers, a highly involved Product Designer with S-WC access, and an anxious customer, establishing clear boundaries on what to share externally versus what remains an internal early idea is crucial to prevent miscommunication and manage expectations effectively.




**Keep** being approachable, firm, and willing to teach. You have a unique ability to slow down and adjust your tone and technical complexity based on the audience, which is incredibly valuable for our team. Please continue making time to sync with non-engineer team members and encouraging our involvement in understanding both the current and ideal path to production, especially given the specific challenges related to Palantir/Warpcore.

This approach has built strong trust across the engineering team, as well as with PM and design. Everyone genuinely enjoys working with him, and his leadership style elevates the entire team. I do not have any major notes for improvement; he has been a consistently positive and valuable contributor.
