**Comment**:
> I recognize that 2026 will be year for Rise8 Marketing to elevate our quality and performance. My focus will be ensuring that the Strategic Pillar 3 objectives—translating delivery expertise into clear value —help us get to that next level, providing the messaging clarity needed for the Rise8 to succeed.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **✅ Keep Doing**
- Prioritize productizing Rise8’s services and prepare for its re-launch by end of Q2. This is the core initiative that translates delivery expertise into clear, saleable value.
- Maintain the focus on outcome-based storytelling through customer evidence. The B2G market prioritizes mission impact and measurable results, making this a critical differentiator.
- Continue to act as the voice of the customer & product in planning sessions like the "big rock" campaign brainstorm to ensure all campaigns are grounded in real customer pain points and accurate service offerings




**🛑 Stop Doing**
- Reduce time spent on ad-hoc, one-off sales enablement requests that are not tied to the 2026 Strategic Pillars. Shift to creating reusable, core assets outlined in Pillar 3 (e.g., messaging framework, case studies).
- Move swiftly from drafting concepts to publishing outward-facing, revenue-driving content




**🚀 Start**
- Deepening PMM key stakeholder relationships (e.g. Growth and Enablement) establishing a regular cadence of meeting to understand key challenges, priorities and areas for collaboration while demonstrating what PMM efforts have produced that can be used by all stakeholders
- Leverage Prod Patrol as a vehicle to better understand Rise8 capabilities and how outcomes in production come to life for our customers
- Develop an Analyst Relations strategy by identifying key firms and analysts to engage with and brief aligned with the launch of “Rise8 OS”
- Formalize a Win/Loss program that leverages quantifiable and qualitative data across our entire customer journey beginning with a focus on won/lost opportunities and then moving to other parts of the funnel to understand how deal velocity can be improved
- Establish a Competitive Intelligence program where key competitor activity is tracked and how it affects Rise8’s business. Also maintain positioning battlecards for each key competitor that can be used by Growth, Marketing and other functions to make more informed decisions

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Completed Discovery calls with PMM key stakeholders to understand challenges and now PMM will help address. Next steps will be to develop and socialize a PMM Charter
2. Revamped OSIT one-pager for use by CFC (formerly SpOC) to internally promote OSIT and therefore Rise8. Sales tools like this will help the Marketing flywheel for USSF and beyond
3. I've gained a foundational understanding of Rise8, the domain, competition, buying behaviors and customer journey. I definitely need to deepen that understanding but feel that I've established a solid base from which to build

> Although still relatively new to the team, Sal's contributions to discussions on current projects and strategy for the future have been impressive and impactful. Sal has done the work to build a solid foundation of understanding who Rise8 is, what we do, and how we seek to be seen across gov and industry. When necessary, he's tactfully disagreed and provided additional considerations based on his professional experience and the information he's gathered on Rise8 to date. He is already an asset to team and I look forward to seeing the impact he'll continue to make as one of our team members and as a Riser. Notably, Sal's on-boarding interview was well-prepared and thorough; I appreciate that included some education on Product Marketing up front to structure the conversation.

> To denote: it's been a bit too early to assess everything above. Sal has only been on the team for a few "real" weeks at the time of this review. That being said, he was hired for a reason, and it shows. While I wasn't a part of his interviewing, I can see whole-heartedly why he was brought to the team. 




I sincerely look forward to seeing his projects and contribution grow in the coming year.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep being unapologetic about sharing your "hard takes". 




Keep your pragmatism in tact; it helps us as a team to stay focused on the bigger mission(s) at hand.




Start being proactive in helping to define what specifically "is" a Rise8 PRODUCT; as I personally am still not 100% certain on what they are (given that we are a service-based-company). 




Keep being a great teammate through and through.
