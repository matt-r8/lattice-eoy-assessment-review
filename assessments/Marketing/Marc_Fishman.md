### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I plan to start learning motion graphics and video editing — to offer the team a more quick-turn solution to these graphical needs that have hindered our progress previously.




I plan to keep working hard — delivering as many projects to prod as possible, and always being honest about time and availability.




I plan to stop being overprotective of my role, and opening myself to sharing design work responsibilities with external partners when it is necessary (either for time, or for the proliferation of new visual ideas).

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> In what will be my first half-year at Rise8, I believe my three best accomplishments are as follows:




1. Being integral in the launching of the "I Ship Outcomes" campaign; providing all the necessary graphics, ads, SWAG, and components asked for in time for us to make the launch. I helped 57 Risers convert their LinkedIn profiles to help "flood the zone" on behalf of the company.




2. I responded to the whirlwind pivot to convert the "Practitioners Academy" to the "ShipSummit" — including working with Milkbar to develop a final logo lockup, and then re-producing all the necessary elements of the initial launch as quickly as possible. 




3. Ultimately, I believe the third accomplishment would be an overall dedication of responsiveness to the Rise8 team as a whole. Upon taking the position, Jordan was adamant to tell me that my role was to "serve all my customers", with the entirety of Rise8 being said customers. As such, I've made strides to introduce myself to as many Risers as possible — especially team leads — to ensure the message of who I am, and what I can do was shared. As such, I am proud that I've been able to provide support to Customer Success (their Milestone report, which remains a work in progress), Growth (proposal covers and PPT cleanup), to Enablement (multiple PPT deck cleanups, infographics, and more).

**Comment**:
> Marc demonstrates the kind of "do what is required" work ethic that is imperative to our fast-moving team. 




He goes above and beyond to help other Risers while supporting our internal team with timely and creative assets. He's receptive to feedback and iterates to achieve team alignment on final products.




Marc is fun to work with. He makes us laugh (when appropriate) and engages with other Risers outside of our team in various Slack channels to continue his integration into Rise8 culture.




Notably, his 1:1 onboarding interviews were extremely well thought out and structured. I'm sure Risers external to the Marketing team noticed and appreciated that too.

Keep Doing: bring your creative ideas and lived experience to our work. Provide options and balance group feedback with your professional perspective on what works, what doesn't, and why; help Risers external to the Marketing team so we all rise together (with the correct colors, fonts, etc.)

**Comment**:
> Marc is a strong presence on the team. He works quickly, is a creative thinker and a strong collaborator. He embodies our Rise8 values—he’s respectful, empathetic and genuinely invested in the people he works with. I also appreciate the way he pushes back thoughtfully when something doesn’t feel right, while staying open to discussion and focused on forward progress.
As his workload has grown, I’d love to see him feel even more comfortable communicating when he needs help prioritizing, or when something needs to come off his plate, or when timelines need to change. He’s managing a lot, and proactively signaling bandwidth boundaries will help ensure he stays energized and doing his best work in the long run.

> Total get it done approach.  Still being relatively new in your role, you act as an agency to your clients, ask clarifying questions to make sure you understand the mission and desired outcome before completing the work, often exceeding expectations.  You have brought stress relief to the team and quickly established trust across many stakeholders.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Raising your hand when you feel you're underwater or you're struggling with priorities. Instead of trying to do it all by the 'need by' date, uncover what's really driving the timeline and either have discussions with the stakeholder or your teammates/leader.  I feel like you're working late into the night sometimes, and that's an opportunity to have you skip meetings to crank through work, or crank through less work if there are ways to shift the due dates around.  Start experimenting more with AI for the basics like Linkedin ad creative or Veo3 for things like animations.  Developing a 'machine' to replace the repeatable and simple parts of your role will free up time for you and increase output - win/win.
Keep: learning and trying new tools to add to your tool belt - as time allows.  The try to do it all can't come at the expense of efficiency or productivity or your wellbeing.  Keep learning Webflow - if you want - but Sweven isn't the most expensive partner for us so we can actually rely on them more.  AI tools within Canva or Illustrator or Veo3 - let's pick one small part of your role that you do over and over, and see if we can build a workflow for it.  I love the willingness to learn - it just has to be measured and intentional.
Stop: Trying to rely solely on your skills and opinions and attitudes towards our creative.  Embrace an outside partner like Joanna - it's healthy to disagree and debate.  You've had a small tendency (read - not a HUGE deal, but it's something to call out) to put down the work of our partners.  You don't need to.  Everything has a backstory and context that you weren't a part of, and the circumstances that led to the outcomes will never fully be understood since you weren't a part of it.  Elevate yourself above and learn from others.  Even if you disagree you will see the rationale and understand in a future project.

> It seems like a lot gets pushed your way by request.  I'd be curious as you get even more familiar with Rise8 to hear your opinions on brand/content/assets and think we'd all benefit from you identifying opportunities to improve that others may not be thinking about.  Not saying you might not be doing that already and not a critique, just a recognition of your talents and hope that you know how appreciated your perspective is.
Oh, and I bet you could do a great revamp of our swag options, that store is getting a bit tired!  :)
