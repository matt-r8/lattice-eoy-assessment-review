## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Rachel Del Vecchio:**
Cara is the steady rock of the marketing team 💪 her context and perspective is invaluable!

**Marc Fishman:**
Cara remains a keystone on the marketing team. For someone who hold part-time hours, her presence is always felt full-time. She is a clear and caring communicator. Her work is completed, and shared on time, and always on brand. She is able to shape our communications to hold a specific ill-defined tone that simply *is* the brand. Far beyond the reaches of any AI-output, she's been integral in tapping into the GovTech language to ensure that the copy we use (in ads, posts, website copy, et al) feels *of the brand*. In today's age, so often co-opted by other tools... she brings a human touch that is necessary for our continued success.

**Vanessa Ten-Kate:**
Cara should keep bringing her calm, steady presence to the team. She consistently works well under pressure and maintains a level-headed approach that helps ground the rest of us. Her reliability, attention to detail, and willingness to jump in wherever needed make her an invaluable teammate. She also does a great job self-managing while keeping others informed, which creates strong alignment across the team. 




I’d encourage Cara to hold her boundaries when needed to respect her 20-hour schedule, so she’s not feeling the need to respond off-hours or while on vacation. Her dedication is clear, and protecting her time will help her stay energized and sustainable in the long run.

**Sal Aziz:**
Cara consistently demonstrates strong organizational skills, attention to detail, and a proactive approach to managing key marketing assets and vendor relationships. She shows excellent brand stewardship by negotiating with external partners for co-branding opportunities and cost-effectiveness on purchased assets. Furthermore, she is a valuable contributor to internal content development, providing detailed, strategic suggested revisions for documents like the "OSIT 1-pager DRAFT" to ensure messaging is clear and accurate. Her prompt follow-up on press opportunities and proactive identification of additional requirements for submissions (like the USCG Marketplace Solution Brief) demonstrate a high level of responsibility and execution.

**McKinnon Pearse:**
Yes, I would enthusiastically rehire her. Although I haven’t worked with her extensively yet, she has consistently demonstrated reliability, quick follow-through, and a strong commitment to producing great work. She is a great team player with a calm, steady demeanor and a clear desire to keep improving. Her responsiveness and positive attitude make her an asset to the team.

**Jordan Dilworth:**
When looking at our values, learn the fastest jumps out.  Experimentation, growth-mindset and fast-paced.  These are the biggest opportunities for Cara as in the grand scheme of things, she is still very, very early in her marketing career and experience.  Confidence and Conviction build over years.  She tried extremely hard, she means well, she's a great teammate and influence on the group - and that matters.  Production and impact and results also matter and there are still development opportunities to tie outputs to impact.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Rachel Del Vecchio:**
Start: Giving more feedback on the copy that comes your way. Sometimes it's not just a copy-editing need but an evaluation of the message itself. Is it communicating the right thing overall? 




Stop: I got nothin! 




Keep: Showing up with your positive, get ship done attitude!

**Marc Fishman:**
Continue to be a team player operating at top speed. 
Continue to make 20 hours a week feel like 50 with all you take on and complete.
Continue to make new members feel welcome.
Start sharing more of your GovTech insite with the newer members of the team, and sharing as much as possible in team meetings. The more we learn about the space, the better all our work will become.

**Vanessa Ten-Kate:**
Cara should keep bringing her calm, steady presence to the team. She consistently works well under pressure and maintains a level-headed approach that helps ground the rest of us. Her reliability, attention to detail, and willingness to jump in wherever needed make her an invaluable teammate. She also does a great job self-managing while keeping others informed, which creates strong alignment across the team. 




I’d encourage Cara to hold her boundaries when needed to respect her 20-hour schedule, so she’s not feeling the need to respond off-hours or while on vacation. Her dedication is clear, and protecting her time will help her stay energized and sustainable in the long run.

**Sal Aziz:**
As we grow, Cara is essential for ensuring that every piece of Marketing content meets our increasingly high standards for quality and performance.




**✅ Keep Doing**
These are the core functions you should continue to execute and strengthen:
- **Maintain the "Big Picture" View:** Continue to "understand the big picture" , ensuring individual tasks across content, programs, and social don't deviate from the overall strategy.
- **Review for Customer-Centricity:** Keep filtering activations through the lens of the Ideal Customer. Your detailed review helps ensure that our content and creative execution are grounded in an "empathetic understanding of the customer and market".




**🛑 Stop Doing**
To optimize efficiency and elevate the team's output, consider stopping or changing these practices:
- **Stop Correcting Errors that Should be Caught Earlier:** Collaborate with content and program leads to establish a tighter QA process, ensuring basic copyediting and fact-checking are handled upstream. This allows you to conserve your valuable time for ensuring high-level brand and tone alignment in every activation.
- **Streamline the Sign-Off Process:** Drive organizational efficiency by automating and streamlining the sign-off process for smaller content pieces. Dedicate your energy to implementing a clear rhythm and cadence that leverages tools for compliance, freeing up time to focus on strategic, high-impact activations.




**🚀 Start**
These new activities will support the strategic objectives of accountability and efficiency in 2026:
- **Start Co-Defining Brand Guidelines for "Revenue First":** Partner with the team to define and document the brand and tone standards specifically for how we talk about **revenue impact** and our "Revenue First" mindset. This ensures consistency when elevating the conversation from busy-work to impact.
- **Start Documenting Brand Standards in Shared Tools:** To support the objective of co-designing a more efficient system, start documenting key brand standards, messaging nuances, and tone guidelines within the team's content management or project tools. This scales your expertise and prevents the need for constant, manual intervention.

**McKinnon Pearse:**
**Keep:**
- Executing quickly and reliably, which makes collaboration smooth and efficient.
- Maintaining her calm, positive demeanor, which helps create a supportive team environment.

**Jordan Dilworth:**
Start really getting into AI editing and GPT building to leverage the tools to improve quality, and move faster.
Start believing and trusting in your work so the CEO doesn't have to review immaterial changes so he can focus on the big changes - if he needs to review it again at all!
Keep being open with shifting roles and jumping into whatever needs to be done with a great attitude.  The only constant is change, and you're always willing to support our various project needs.
Stop - and this is a hard one - completely rewriting articles or paragraphs that result in minimal change to the impact.  This is the biggest time killer IMO and oftentimes entire articles or paragraphs are rewritten and the net positive gain is not worth the effort.  Change for impact, or change for accuracy.
