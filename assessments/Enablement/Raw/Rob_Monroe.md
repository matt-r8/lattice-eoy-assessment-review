**Comment**:
> I strive to consistently embody Rise8’s core values and to hold myself to the same high standard I hope to inspire in others. In my role as Product Management Practice Lead, I work to balance strategic thinking with hands-on support—helping shape the long-term vision while also staying close to the day-to-day work and needs of the team. I bring deep product management experience and a thoughtful, analytical approach, and I do my best to use that to elevate the quality of our work across the PM organization. Just as importantly, I care deeply about both the outcomes we deliver and the people behind them. I make a conscious effort to be approachable, generous with my time, and supportive as a mentor and collaborator. My goal is to be a reliable partner, especially under pressure, and to serve as a force multiplier who helps others grow and succeed.




Some things that are on my radar that I am sure others will note in my review
1. I can move really fast once something is clear for me. It's not that I don't care about others, I just move when I know how and where to move. I want to get better about aligning others and regularly checking-in more intentionally to pulse-check the alignment, so I'm not leaving people feeling left behind.
2. Practice how I deliver messages. I'm struggling to find the right balance between responding to critique feedback about PM performance at Rise8, and how best to get PMs to take that seriously. I gave ample opportunities for PMs to make the leap, and most did. The ones that didn't, truly needed to be let go due to culture or skill deficiencies. Even though I was transparent about these situations, and I relentlessly offered support to help PMs, there was still an awkward tension between us at times, because they see the assertion from me and associate and take on stress of real consequences. To me its important that employees have clear expectations, and I would have no integrity if I did anything differently.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
- Being more direct about what I want or need. My default leadership style has always been servant leadership, and so I tend to focus less on my wants and needs. I don't think the right move is to stop this leadership trait, but for now I will introduce a ***Goal: to intentionally introduce new habit of telling peers and leadership what I want or need with specific phrasing, and confirm clarity***
- Most of my energy has been spent on operationalization and optimization. In 2026 I want to prove I can introduce net-new value to our organization with the ***Goal: of designing and launching new services that drive 'new value' for Rise8***
- Being more specific about what done and good looks like by setting the ***Goal: that Risers align quickly, and reduce their time to close competency or skills gaps***




**Stop**
- Chasing multiple priorities, and limiting what I can deliver in terms of quality outputs, outcomes and business impact
- Being involved in order to ensure we achieve the outcome




**Continue**
- Iterating on how to improve enablement strategies with better feedback loops and personalization with Riser ICs. ***Goal: improve speed and effectiveness of adaptation to unique contexts, in order to increase credibility faster***
- Offering my expertise, perspective and time to Risers, but with the ***Goal: of making any activity or output I deliver, be consumed by 10 or more people (less 1:1 engagement).***

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **1) Outcome in Prod (OIP) Quality (Achieved)**
- **Context**: at the end of 2024, outcomes in prod submissions had the following quality performance stats that showed Delivery teams were not working in outcome-oriented ways:
   - **~80%** had redundant outcome results in their impact results
   - **76%** needed revisioning
   - **42%** required multiple revision rounds
   - **35%** had quantitative metrics 
- **SMART Goal**: To improve these quality stats, by November 2025, **100% of delivery teams who have passed their inception milestone will demonstrate outcome-oriented ways of working**, defined as each team having the following:
   - Adoption of value stream mapping (VSM) and impact mapping artifacts
   - A clearly defined and measurable one mission metric that matters
   - An outcome-oriented roadmap (OOR) with outcome in prod experiments defined for at least 12 months
   - A commitment to including qualitative and quantitative metrics
- **Activities and Outputs:** I partnered with peers and leadership to introduce the following
   - Standardized and launched VSMs, Impact Maps and OOR templates and RiseU resources
   - Provided training and feedback sessions to improve resources
   - Introduced definition-of-done quality checks
   - Produced RiseU content on metrics and experiment methods
   - Launched Gemini Gem to assist in designing and refining outcome in prod hypothesis experiments
- **Results**
   - **100%** of delivery teams have adopted our standards
   - **100%** of teams have at least 12 month OOR
   - Redundant outcome<>impact submissions dropped quarter over quarter from **80%** (2024) -> **76%** (1Q25) -> **62%** (2Q25) -> **40%** (3Q25) -> **~10%** (4Q25)
   - **78%** of submissions are accepted on their first attempt
   - **~81%** of submissions use both qualitative and quantitative metrics
   - Randomly selected Riser PMs who received the Gemini Gem were asked if anything changed in their approach with their teams after within 3 weeks
      - *"Before I was kind of boiling the ocean. With the recommended updates [from the Gem] I've broken my experiments down into smaller chunks that proceed in logical progression."*
      - *"I really appreciated how it guided me on a path to building my roadmap."*
      - *"I appreciate the prioritize recommendations that it gave so I know where to start with my personal improvement."* 
      - *"The Gem kept digging into my answers and forced me to think really hard on what I can actually measure and segment well, as well as how to design smaller tests where appropriate."*








**2) Hire & retain A-players, respectfully move B-players faster (Mostly Achieved)**
- **SMART Goal:** By November, 2025, I will strengthen our Product talent and standards in order to improve customer satisfaction with Rise8 delivery team performance:
   - Achieving **≥97% retention** of **A-players**.
   - Ensuring that **100% of new hires** into Product roles are assessed as **A-players at hire**.
   - Reducing B-players within 30 days of confirming their player status, by giving each B-player either:
      - a PIP with clear get to A-player status and decision date.
      - or a respectful, timely transition out.
   - To validate this goal, I will partner with HR, as well as Sr and above PMs to
      - maintain a talent calibration roster sheet
      - track an A-player retention KPI
      - introduce formal PIP plans
      - adjust our skills assessment interview process
- **Results:** 
   - PM skill assessment interview adjustments
      - **Candidate rejection rate increased from 22% to 90%**; increased confidence with contingent offers
      - **Eliminated salary compensation negotiation** because of clear performance feedback
      - Normalized **average salary band penetration from 88% to 65%**
   - **95% of A-players were retained; avoided <90% result**
      - We unfortunately lost Cody Ray in 3Q25 siting lack of career path clarity and didn't feel valued based on engagement placement
      - Art Tovar confirmed he accepted an offer at USAA, but then turned it down after I spoke with him - learning from our experience with Cody Ray
         - *The mission of Rise8 to make a real difference in the world is why I want to be here*
         - *Im really appreciative of how you (rob) gave me chances to prove I could make the journey*
         - *If i were to go somewhere else I think i might become bored - there's still so much to always learn and grow here at Rise8*
         - *I feel so relieved to finally make this decision*
   - 100% of confirmed B-players were removed, **but took longer than 30 days to accomplish**
   - **>50% of Delivery Lead positions are held by PMs**.








**3) PM–Design relationships & skillsets (Partially Achieved)**
- **SMART Goal**: Materially improve PM–Design collaboration and skills in 2025 by 
1. Running at least **6 joint PM–Design practice sessions or workshops** (e.g., discovery, hypothesis writing, outcome mapping, experiment design).
2. Ensuring that **100% of PM–Designer pairs** on Delivery accounts **co-create discovery artifacts and outcome-based experiments** using resources I publish and teach.
3. **Improving average PM–Design partnership satisfaction scores by at least 1 point on a 5-point scale**, using a lightweight **quarterly pulse survey** compared to a **Q1 2025 baseline**. 
- **Results:** 
   - Only pulled off **3 join PM-Design workshops**, including the off-site in Austin (this was IC-led; I only coached and supported when asked)
      - Off-site was on budget with no additional finance support asks
   - **100% of PM–Designer pairs** on Delivery accounts **did co-create** discovery artifacts and outcome-based experiments **using resources I published or taught**.
   - **I did not formally measure Designer<>PM satisfaction scores**
      - PM and Designer feedback from the off-site concluded the opportunity to learn from Dale Carnegie and Karen Martin were invaluable, and well worth the pro dev money spent
      - ~10% of Design/PM practitioners still question if VSMs are the right tool for Rise8

**Comment**:
> Rob is an incredible resource for PMs of all skill levels.  I'm really excited to see how his expertise can be articulated and presented via Enablement within Rise8 and the industry at large.  For a lot of the criteria above, Rob not only has demonstrated the value implicitly, but there are often concrete examples.  Certainly for growth, and grit, and doing what is required, Rob will absolutely dig in to make things happen.  And he set the standards for outcome oriented project management.  It has been great to have him on Prod Hall to help clarify standards and help teams better express the impact of their outcomes.  I'm kind of curious whether the rules around outcomes could be simpler.  I dream of a world where we don't need a team of experts to adjudicate every submission.  But I have really enjoyed working with Rob as a DPL - his logic, clarity, and rigor has really pushed the PM practice forward and I look forward to seeing that expertise operate at scale.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Passing on positive comments as often as possible.  




Continue: Clearly articulating PM standards and practices; offering support and pairing when needed; grappling with the practical application of general standards; collecting feedback from CSMs and addressing it and being a thoughtful and conscientious presence in the Delivery org.  Don't disappear entirely into the Enablement bubble!  The conversations are all happening out here!

**Comment**:
> Rob lives out the Rise8 core values and expects that of his peers too. He's able to easily navigate between the strategic high level as well as tactically supporting initiatives and peers. Rob cares deeply about both the work he does and the people he supports in the PM department.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Continue: Asking for feedback from the PMs on the initiatives you are driving to understand what has/hasn't been effective and continue to tailor and tweak our understanding based on learnings. You drive a lot of broad initiatives across the PM department, continue to learn and iterate as you drive work and practice consistency to adapt to how implementation is going.




Start: In your new Enablement Lead role, you'll no longer have PMs reporting to you and your levers for driving change will be influence and credibility. Start to find ways to create feedback loops and check-in points for yourself on your ability to influence others so you can adapt as needed. With the EL role being so new, I'm not seeing a problem here per-se but something I would watch for in the new year knowing how things change when you no longer have direct supervisor authority.

**Comment**:
> Rob has probably had the biggest impact on getting teams to report Outcomes.  The work he did with Drumbeats, Lattice Goals, VSMs, and Outcome-Oriented Roadmaps really set teams up to think about the outcomes they wanted and the follow-through to document them in the Employee site.




I would have rated Rob higher on do hard things and do right by the customer.  I feel like we needed to execute some PM swaps more quickly than we did.  Which impacted team performance where PM fits weren't good.




I think the Lattice Goal Tracker was a great idea, but it doesn't feel like an organic place for that.  The Goal tool is definitely built for this kind of stuff, but Lattice itself seemed to be the issue.  I would have liked to see this done in the employee site instead, as all things outcomes happen there.  Could be me but I didn't get value from not sure if teams were either.  I knew it was there but not how it was being used was it in test, did we move away from it, or should I have been more diligent in using it?




Perhaps this was a result of some performance in the PM side but some of the PM population seemed unsure, or carried the stress about what Rob would think.  Probably appropriate, given the performance issues. Despite going to enablement, I think it would be good for Rob to reflect on ways to still be direct but create just the right amount of stress. I could be way off here but I didn't get the same vibe from PE folks who were on PIP.

**Comment**:
> Three areas I think you could work on if you really want to be A++:
Alignment... I think sometimes your urgency and bias for action cause you to skip the alignment. Sometimes the up front part of rolling out something new, but then especially on the reiteration of the why along the way. Taking the time to really dig in with people on why will be a huge unlock for your leadership.
Focusing on Activities and Outputs when needed... this became a huge top-down focus in 2024/2025, but knowing when you can let someone run with an outcome versus when you need to give them a lesson in how to achieve one is key. It's not always micromanagement to teach the how... in many contexts that's a positive thing called coaching. On the flip side, "empowerment" without enablement is neglect. You have both skills, you just have to get confident in assessing which to employ. 
Kindness and making others feel cared for. I think you do this well when there's a clear separation of intention... like if someone comes to you specifically for that. You clearly care about people. But when you are in problem solving mode, you often lose that to the point of people feeling not only not cared for, but sometimes attacked or hurt. It's something to be mindful of. Aggression is good. I don't think we can get much done without it. So I wouldn't say to put it away or you will lose your edge and something that makes you great. It's just integrating it and avoiding the shadow forms. A big thing that might help you, specifically, is speech tone and patterns. Your tone, and sometimes volume, can get pretty harsh along with tempo/pacing. Fixing those two things will drastically lower that perception (that you don't care on a personal level when you challenge directly... obnoxious aggression in radical candor).

Keep being such a strong advocate for ways of working, culture, and leading by example when it comes to grit and growth mindset!
