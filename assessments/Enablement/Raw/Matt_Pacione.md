**Comment**:
> ## Delivery of Outcomes & Business Impact
I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired because I consistently deliver measurable business outcomes while strengthening the technical foundation of the organization. This year, the teams I support in platform and cyber delivered **46 of the company's 100 approved outcomes (46%)** across seven major platform initiatives, including:




- **KM Platform:** 14 production outcomes (largest project delivery, 7 on Platform alone)
- **VA Lighthouse SecRel:** 13 production outcomes
- **VA Lighthouse Dev Enablement:** 7 outcomes
- **VA OCTO Watchtower:** 7 outcomes
- **Landing Zone, Unified Platform, and USPTO:** 5 combined outcomes




Beyond direct delivery, I contributed to strategic growth by supporting technical exchange meetings, stakeholder engagement, and solution design for FORGE (awarded) and Bifrost (awarded), directly impacting the company's growth pipeline and future revenue.




## Platform Governance & Technical Leadership
I established and maintained platform governance standards that enable consistent, high-quality delivery across the organization:




- **Developed baseline platform health metrics** that will be reported org-wide, increasing visibility and accountability across contracts
- **Created Platform Engineering Anchor documentation** that standardizes technical leadership expectations
- **Led the ATTV initiative** for secure, repeatable platform deployment in AWS GovCloud using SpectroCloud Palette Vertex and AWS Landing Zone Accelerator, enabling rapid environment deployment for both FORGE and Tracer product teams
- **Supported external partnerships** with Palantir, VA, SpectroCloud, Chainguard, and SecurityCompass, providing premium tooling (hardened images, SD Elements licenses) that directly influenced multiple contract awards




Throughout the year, I maintained hands-on technical involvement—investing over many hours in engineering work during critical periods—while developing platform training curriculum, conducting architecture reviews, and creating reusable infrastructure-as-code for AWS ECS deployments that accelerate team productivity.




## Addressing Mid-Year Feedback & Demonstrating Growth
At mid-year review, peers identified areas for improvement around getting ahead of crisis situations with platform engineers and building my engineering foundation. I took decisive action:




**On Interview & Onboarding Process:**




- **Revamped the complete interview process**, creating platform and cybersecurity engineering skills assessments that improved hiring quality
- **Personally conducted every culture interview** for incoming engineers/analysts in my practice, ensuring cultural and verifying skills fit
- **Invested in hiring activities** during Q3-Q4, successfully hiring new Risers and transitioning existing engineers
- **Implemented performance improvement plans (PIPs)** that successfully brought engineers back to A-player performance, and met with several other coachable B-Players to bring them to A-Player performance
- **Made decisive separation decisions** when needed, acting quickly rather than waiting for situations to deteriorate




**On Engineering Foundation:**




- **Launched Book Clubs (XP, Platform Maturity, Platform Strategy)** To upskill the practice on emerging technologies
- **Developed Platform Training Curriculum** that enables faster engineer onboarding
- **Created 8gents repository** and AI Solutions Repo, providing production-ready tooling for the entire company
- **Allocated TAK CI/CD engagement** and ATTV beach project, demonstrating current technical capabilities through hands-on infrastructure development
- **Increased hands-on engineering time to 40%+ of work hours** during critical project phases




## Leadership Through Decisive Action
I demonstrate the "courage to be disliked" by taking charge when situations demand it:
- **Resolved FORGE anchor transition** between Chris Butler and Asare Nkansah through direct coaching and clear role definition, resulting in successful team stabilization
- **Worked directly with Josh Pritchett** as delivery lead to assess and resolve cybersecurity team delivery issues, reallocating resources to ensure customer outcomes
- **Maintained the highest 3rd Quarter eNPS** of all practices while managing difficult personnel situations
- **Conducted weekly/monthly practice/team reviews** with leadership and customer success, proactively identifying and removing blockers across all accounts




## Conclusion
I would be enthusiastically rehired because I deliver tangible business outcomes (46% of company production results in the practices I support), establish technical standards that scale across the organization, take decisive action on difficult people situations, and continuously invest in both my technical capabilities and the growth of others. The mid-year feedback I received translated directly into measurable improvements in hiring and performance improvement process, engineering involvement, and leadership decisiveness—demonstrating my commitment to continuous growth and organizational impact.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Context**: As of late October 2025, I transitioned from Platform Practice Lead to Enablement Lead, reporting to the Enablement Director. My focus is enabling platform engineering teams through training, R&D projects, and AI-powered tooling.




**Summary**: This reflects my transition from Practice Lead (managing people, operations, crises) to Enablement Lead (building capability, tools, training). I'm stopping direct decision-making on personnel and operations—shifting to an advisory role where Delivery Leads are my customers. I'm keeping my technical depth, partnership building, decisiveness, and learning culture while becoming a force multiplier—my success measured by how much faster platform teams can deliver, not my individual contributions.




## **START**
**1. Structured AI Enablement Curriculum for Platform Engineers**
I will develop and deliver comprehensive AI training focused on how platform engineers can leverage AI tools to troubleshoot, deploy, secure, and observe platforms more efficiently. Hands-on workshops covering AI-assisted debugging, infrastructure-as-code generation, security scanning, and observability pattern recognition. Each module will include real-world scenarios, measurable productivity improvements, and reusable prompts/workflows engineers can immediately apply.
**2. "Paved Path" Documentation & Templates**
I will create and maintain standardized deployment patterns, infrastructure templates, and best practice documentation giving developers and designers a clear path from local vibe coding to production. This includes reusable Terraform/IaC modules, security-by-default configurations, and observability bootstrapping. Each "paved path" will include step-by-step guides, troubleshooting playbooks, and AI-assisted validation scripts reducing time-to-production while maintaining security and reliability standards.
**3. Feedback Loop Mechanism with Platform Teams**
I will establish systematic feedback collection from platform teams on enablement needs, training gaps, and tooling requirements through quarterly surveys, monthly office hours, or embedded observation periods. The goal is ensuring enablement efforts are driven by actual team needs rather than assumed gaps, with clear metrics for effectiveness.
**4. R&D Project Portfolio Management**
I will create a transparent system for proposing, tracking, and graduating R&D initiatives with clear selection criteria, success metrics, and graduation paths from experiment to production-ready tooling. The performance management application and vibe coding environment will serve as pilot projects with documented processes other engineers can follow.








## **STOP**
**1. Direct Decision-Making on Personnel and Practice Operations**
I will stop serving as the primary decision-maker for performance issues, PIPs, separations, and practice-wide operational overhead. These responsibilities now belong to Practice Leads and Delivery Leads—they are my customers, and I'm here to support them. My role shifted from manager to advisor: I may provide recommendations when consulted on A-player assessments or enablement strategies, but I'm no longer the decision-maker. I'll support Delivery Leads by enabling their engineers with training, tooling, and reusable patterns.
**2. Over-Indexing on Servant Leadership**
I will stop defaulting to servant leadership when situations require decisive action and clear direction. My mid-year character improvement goal called out "taking charge" and avoiding the "servant seat." When I have conviction about the right path forward—whether technical decisions, R&D direction, or enablement strategy—I'll state it clearly rather than seeking consensus that delays action. Delivery Leads and platform engineers need decisive guidance on what to adopt, not endless options.
**3. Underestimating My Own Capabilities**
I will stop doubting myself and trust my judgment. I need to acknowledge my strengths and speak with conviction rather than minimizing contributions. I will stop hiding behind others, staying silent, and over-rotating on wondering if what I'm saying is true. I have good insights and need to share them with the team confidently.








## **KEEP**
**1. Decisive Action on Enablement and Technical Decisions**
I will continue making timely, clear decisions on technical direction, R&D prioritization, enablement initiatives, and tool/pattern adoption. While no longer making personnel decisions, I'll maintain the same decisiveness determining what to build, who to train, and which enablement efforts have highest impact. When consulted on A-player assessments or hiring recommendations, I'll provide clear input—but in an advisory role. Successfully managing two PIPs, upskilling 3 coachable B-Players, and making quick separation decisions demonstrates this decisiveness works; I'll apply that clarity to enablement decisions.
**2. Deep Hands-On Technical Work**
I will continue maintaining strong hands-on technical skills through R&D projects, building actual tools, and working directly with infrastructure code. Mid-year feedback called this out ("save time to build engineering foundation") and peer reviewers noted hands-on pairing "helps the trust of the Practice." As Enablement Lead, technical credibility is critical—I can't effectively teach what I don't actively practice. The difference now is my technical work should produce reusable tools, patterns, and documentation.
**3. AI-Powered Productivity Focus**
I will continue investing heavily in AI tooling and sharing capabilities broadly. The 8gents repository and AI Solutions Repo represent the right direction for enablement work. I'll expand from conceptual exploration to practical application, making AI-assisted platform engineering the default. Every R&D project, training module, and troubleshooting guide should demonstrate how AI accelerates work with specific prompts/workflows others can adopt.
**4. Building Reusable Infrastructure & Tooling**
I will continue creating production-ready infrastructure components, templates, and automation teams can immediately adopt. The ATTV initiative, AWS ECS IaC scripts, and TAK CI/CD work demonstrate the pattern—build once, enable many. As Enablement Lead, every problem I solve should produce artifacts preventing others from solving the same problem.
**5. Strategic External Partnerships**
I will continue building relationships with tool vendors, open-source communities, and technology partners providing value to platform teams. Partnerships with Palantir, SpectroCloud, Chainguard, and SecurityCompass delivered premium tooling this year. As Enablement Lead, these relationships become force multipliers—securing better tools, training resources, early access, and technical expertise I can channel to teams.
**6. Open Feedback Culture & Continuous Learning**
I will continue fostering direct communication, actively seeking feedback, and modeling continuous learning. This was my highest-rated area as Practice Lead (Communication 4.67, Feedback 4.33) and remains critical for enablement. I need to know what's working, what's not, where teams struggle, and what they need next. The discipline to incorporate feedback into curriculum/tooling improvements will determine enablement effectiveness.
**7. Cross-Functional Collaboration**
I will continue working across organizational boundaries to understand needs, share knowledge, and build bridges between platform engineering and other practices. Mid-year feedback showed strong collaboration scores (self 3.0, peers 4.67)—a strength to leverage. As Enablement Lead, I need to understand how designers, security engineers, delivery teams, and customers work to provide effective enablement.
**8. Experimental Mindset & R&D Appetite**
I will continue embracing experimentation, trying new technologies, and investing time in R&D without guaranteed payoff. The performance management application represents this mindset—build something, learn from it, extract reusable patterns, share knowledge. Not every experiment succeeds, but the learning and tooling produced creates organizational capability. I'll balance production-ready solutions with exploratory work.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For the first three quarters of 2025 (January through October), I served as Platform Engineering Practice Lead, managing seven delivery teams across our largest contracts. In late October 2025, I transitioned to Enablement Lead, reporting to the Enablement Director, where I now focus on enabling platform engineering teams through training, R&D projects, and AI-powered tooling. The accomplishments below reflect both my Practice Lead tenure and the early momentum I've built in my new enablement role.




## **Summary**
My 2025 accomplishments span two distinct but complementary roles: as Practice Lead, I delivered the largest share of company outcomes (46%) while building hiring and team development infrastructure; as Enablement Lead, I'm leveraging that delivery experience to build force multiplier systems that will accelerate platform engineering productivity company-wide. The transition from operator to enabler is well underway, with early enablement wins already showing measurable impact across multiple teams and contracts.




## **1. Team Outcomes & Platform Delivery Excellence**
**As Practice Lead, my seven teams delivered 46 of the company's 100 production outcomes in 2025 (46%)** This delivery success was achieved while maintaining the highest third-quarter eNPS score of all practices, demonstrating both output excellence and team satisfaction.
**Key delivery highlights:**
- **KM Platform**: 14 outcomes (our largest platform project, 7 from Section 31 and 7 from Platform specifically)
- **VA Lighthouse SecRel**: 13 outcomes (security release management)
- **VA Lighthouse Dev Enablement**: 7 outcomes (developer productivity)
- **Watchtower (VA OCTO)**: 7 outcomes (observability & monitoring)
- **Additional projects**: Landing Zone (2), Unified Platform (2), USPTO cATO (1)
**Leadership approach that drove these results:**
- Conducted weekly practice reviews with leadership and customer success to identify and remove blockers
- Implemented engineering anchor documentation for each delivery team, establishing clear technical leadership patterns
- Actively swarmed on team-blocking issues, assessing problems and equipping engineers with the support needed to deliver to production
- Assessed individual employee performance throughout the year, including implementing two successful Performance Improvement Plans that resulted in improved team performance
This delivery record was achieved across our most critical contracts, including FORGE (our largest), VA ACE reallocations, and BCCB Bifrost expansions, consistently meeting customer commitments while maintaining team health and satisfaction.








## **2. Hiring, Staffing & Team Development Infrastructure**
**I recruited and onboarded new engineers in 2025, from a count of 28 to 42** while simultaneously building reusable hiring infrastructure that improved our assessment quality and candidate selection across platform and cybersecurity practices.
**Hiring & recruitment systems I built:**
- **Created platform and cybersecurity engineering skills assessments** that helped us determine precise skill levels for candidates, moving beyond subjective evaluations to data-driven hiring decisions
- **Conducted every culture interview** for engineers joining my practice, ensuring cultural fit while training interviewers on quality assessment patterns
- **Recruited and trained several platform and cyber interviewers**, establishing a consistent interview skills assessment framework that's now used across multiple practices
**Strategic staffing & development work:**
- **FORGE team staffing**: Hand-selected and allocated the right engineers for our largest contract, including coaching Asare through his transition to anchor role after identifying leadership challenges with the previous anchor
- **VA ACE reallocations**: Successfully transitioned engineers from other teams to support new contract requirements
- **Delivery Lead enablement**: Worked extensively with Josh Pritchett (and other DLs) as he learned to understand FORGE project dynamics and assess cyber team delivery issues, helping him get the right people in the right seats
- **Nick Weiss upskilling**: Created custom curriculum to transition him from application-focused work to platform technical product management, devoting dedicated training time to ensure he could effectively support platform teams
**Addressing mid-year feedback on crisis intervention:**
- My mid-year review highlighted the need to "move quicker to provide feedback and coaching, pick up on signals quicker" regarding performance issues
- I revamped the interview process to catch A-player fit earlier
- Successfully implemented two PIPs that resulted in performance improvement (not separation)
- Documented underperformance issues and made decisive separation decisions when appropriate, not hesitating when it was the right time
- This proactive intervention approach directly contributed to our high Q3 eNPS while maintaining delivery quality








## **3. Early Enablement Wins & Force Multiplier Infrastructure**
**In my first four weeks as Enablement Lead (late October 2025 to present), I've already established foundational enablement systems and R&D projects** that are accelerating platform team productivity and setting the stage for systematic AI integration across engineering practices.
**AI enablement initiatives launched:**
- **AI Solutions Repo**: Created quick-start repository for Claude AI setup that any team can use for rapid AI-assisted development, reducing setup time from hours to minutes
- **8gents Repository**: Built company-wide agent orchestration framework for consistent AI agent use across projects and repositories
- **VA SecRel & Platform Team AI Enablement**: Worked specifically with these teams to enable AI as a productivity booster, providing hands-on coaching and proven prompts for platform engineering tasks
**R&D projects & infrastructure tooling:**
- **Performance Management Application**: Leading R&D project with designers and developers to build internal tooling, serving as pilot for enablement-driven R&D portfolio management
- **Vibe Coding Environment**: Created local development setup for designers and developers that provides clear path to AWS deployment while GitLab pipelines are being completed
- **TAK CICD Support**: Orchestrated eight-week engagement where handpicked engineers helped teams set up proper CI/CD pipelines, establishing reusable patterns for future projects
- **AWS ECS IaC Scripts (ATTV Beach Project)**: Built infrastructure-as-code for quick deployment of services into AWS Fargate with security groups, ALBs, and networking properly configured—eliminating repetitive infrastructure setup work
**Systems with lasting impact:**
- **AI Growth Solutions Implementation**: Built tool for Growth team to review PWS documents, write reports/summaries quickly, and assess ideal customer profile fit—then handed it off for them to own maintenance and upkeep
- These early wins demonstrate the force multiplier approach I'm bringing to enablement: rather than solving problems directly for teams, I'm building reusable tools, templates, and documentation that prevent teams from solving the same problems repeatedly
**Transition momentum:**
- Successfully shifted from Practice Lead operations (personnel management, weekly reviews, allocations) to enablement focus in under a month
- Maintained hands-on technical involvement while establishing new enablement patterns
- Already building curriculum, tooling, and R&D portfolio that will scale across multiple platform teams

> Start: add some cli skills assessment to PE as it is a foundational skill and the easiest thing to test mastery in.  Mastering a tool such as CLI is a good predictor that they'll master whatever is put in front of them. If not cli some other common tool PE uses will do. Maybe how well they navigate an IDE?  Possibly less important with Claude taking over.




Keep providing clear and caring feedback to Risers




I think we in Engineering have a lot of room to improve practice, both in PE and SWE.  Looking forward to see the impact Matt makes in Enablement!

I've given you this feedback before, but to continue to have the respect of your team, you've got to really push on platform skills. People love you as a coach/teacher, but over time if you don't stay Staff+ in skill, it will be hard for the practice to follow you. So keep finding ways to stay fresh and advancing.

> Matt is a great collaborator who consistently brings innovative ideas and takes initiative without needing to be asked - his work on 8gents and the solutions repository are perfect examples of this.




However, I'd like to see him be more assertive in defending his strong ideas. He tends to be agreeable when pushing back could lead to better outcomes. I also notice he sometimes takes on new commitments before fully completing existing work, which causes delays. His experiments show great promise, but they often stop just short of broader adoption - they need feedback from more Risers and active promotion to maximize their impact.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
- Seeking feedback earlier and from a broader group of Risers during development, not just after completion. This will help refine your work and increase its relevance beyond platform engineering.
- Actively promoting and educating all Risers on how to use the solutions you build. Your innovations deserve company-wide visibility and adoption.
- Advocating more forcefully for your ideas during collaboration. Your instincts are good - trust them and push back when you see a better path forward.
**Stop:**
- Saying yes to new commitments when you have significant work in progress. Your existing initiatives deserve your full attention to reach completion.
- Defaulting to 1:1 or small group implementations. Design with all of Rise8 in mind from the start.
**Keep:**
- Taking initiative to experiment with new technology without waiting for permission. Your work with AI tools like 8gents and the solutions repo demonstrates exactly the kind of innovation Rise8 needs.

> Matt has been a great resource to help through some difficult engagement issues specifically with the whole USPTO issue. I knew I could count on him to help guide on what's best to do for the employee and the relationship with customer. Matt has also been great to collab on improvements to the cybersecurity hiring and interviewing scripts and was always looking for feedback. In the one instance where I asked for some additional coaching he was quick to reach out and provide guidance.  




I also appreciated him reaching out to me when there was some confusion of the DL/EL/CS roles and responsibilities. 




I don't work with Matt day to day, so the only recommendation I would have would be related the hiring process and ensuring we tracking which people we're hiring for each position. The FORGE hiring was kind of hectic with all the people we had to hire and at times I wasn't sure which position we already filled. 




One thing I'd like to see understand more from an EL is how they interact with individuals (it seems more of an as needed).

> Matt is an incredibly sharp individual, one of those guys who Im not sure Rise8 would be the same if / when he starts his own thing. I have been super impressed with his vibe since the day I met him. He’s very fun, outgoing, technical, and empathetic. I really appreciate that he was able to support Branden through a pretty rough time in his life, and it was great to feel like he was taken care of both professionally and personally. Mat’s a true A-player!




In our work together in ATTV, I have gotten to see Matt rotate through whatever persona was needed for the lifecycle of the project. From single point of context on what the history of the project, driving it forward one step at a time, to leading architecture to most recently “here’s a vision and the tools. With AI and a little guidance you can lead the way here as devs and help define what is needed next”. I think it is cool to see you empowering the team on where to go next.




ATTV is a strange project sometimes, from the fluctuating vision to the spiky resources, it’s a challenging product to be the PM for. It can be difficult to get insights into what leadership is looking for on the project. On one hand, I could definitely do a better job of being proactive and hyper-engaging in the product to get it to be a super-success. On the other hand, there are times when Matt gets new info that I’m not tracking and it shifts the vision or strategy quicker than I anticipate. Matt does as good fo a job as he can keeping me in the loop, which I appreciate a ton - but there’s almost always something that I feel just a touch behind on.




I prefer Mat’s style of “inform as fast as possible the core people who might be affected”, but there have been times where I am in several differen DMs or having conversations with folks about resourcing on SecRel and it feels like a game of telephone. I would tell Sharon, who would tell you - but you had already told dev X something else. It never caused any real harm, but it was a bit stressful trying to keep track of what was the most recent and who had the information. It’s incredible that Matt was able to keep this stuff moving with all his responsibilities to begin with - but I think being more deliberate about those discussions would be helpful. I ack that it’s a catch22 because you either get transparent and early - but wrong. Or you get accurate and late, and are ambushed. I would rather have the former every time, but that’s not true for everyone and some people just want to hear one thing.




Matt is always bold and taking on tough challenges, focusing on outcomes and people too. He’s a top 1% in almost every category. I do think Matt and I could have done some solid feedback before this. There are times when it’s hard for both of us to focus on ATTV, and I think we could do a better job at Keeping it Real on where we’re performing on our expectations for delivering something real. You would be a fool not to hire M@!

> For the next year, the main thing is to **keep** being that A-Player: **keep** your fun, outgoing, and empathetic vibe, and **keep** rotating through the personas ATTV needs. Your style of "inform as fast as possible" is preferred, so **keep** doing that. The main area to **start** is to be more deliberate about our communication, especially on resourcing. To avoid the 'game of telephone' (where I'm in several different DMs), we should **start** using a single, clear channel for those decisions. Finally, let's **start** setting a regular check-in so we can 'Keep it Real' with each other about our expectations for ATTV and make sure we're aligned.
