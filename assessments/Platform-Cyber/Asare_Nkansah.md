### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I strongly agree with the statement that I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role. Over the past year, I have consistently demonstrated proactive leadership, technical excellence, and a forward-thinking mindset, particularly on our company's most significant and strategic project, the FORGE program.
My impact is perhaps best illustrated by my role as the anchor for what is arguably the most important team within this major project. Despite being overlooked for the position initially, I stepped into this critical leadership role on very short notice to support the team's objectives. In this capacity, I have been instrumental in guiding major architectural decisions, leading technical implementation, and ensuring seamless collaboration with other teams, proving my commitment to the project's success above all else.
This leadership was pivotal during the FORGE program kickoff, where I spearheaded an extremely delicate and highly technical conversation about the cloud environment's architecture. By synthesizing thousands of pages of documentation, I successfully facilitated a session that bridged the gap between the current state and a viable future-state architecture, setting a clear and strategic direction for the program from the outset. I have also ~forged~ really valuable relationships with the program's key stakeholders, becoming a household name for Rise8 when it comes to our involvement on the program.
Beyond my architectural leadership, I am a passionate advocate for the company's "AI First" mentality. I gave this vision a practical application by creating the FORGE Librarian, an AI-powered tool that provides a common, accessible knowledge base for the entire program. This initiative not only solves a critical information-sharing problem but also serves as a tangible example of how we can innovate and integrate AI into our daily engineering practices.
This leadership is built on a foundation of deep, hands-on technical expertise with the critical technologies that power our platform. I have been instrumental in deploying and managing key systems, including the ELK Stack for observability, Artifactory for artifact lifecycle management, ArgoCD for declarative GitOps delivery, Kyverno for Kubernetes policy enforcement, and all just to name a few. My experience extends to the foundational layer, including the complexities of OpenShift installation. This comprehensive technical ownership has directly fortified our core infrastructure, ensuring the robust stability and security required to support our most ambitious architectural and AI initiatives.
In summary, my performance has been defined by stepping up to lead, driving innovation, and delivering tangible results on our most vital initiatives. I am confident that my contributions have created significant value and that I would be enthusiastically rehired to continue driving our success.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing**
- **Leading and coordinating the FORGE team.** I will continue to guide our architecture and technical strategy while emphasizing delegation and effective collaboration. My goal is to ensure we are not only hitting our technical targets but also working together as efficiently as possible.
- **Mentoring and enabling team members.** I will continue to invest in the growth of my teammates by sharing knowledge, providing guidance on complex technical challenges, and creating opportunities for them to take ownership of key components.
- **Championing our "AI First" culture.** I will continue to maintain and promote the FORGE Librarian while actively seeking out new ways to apply AI to solve our program's challenges and improve our engineering workflows.
#### **Start Doing**
- **Proactively identifying and prototyping new AI use cases.** Building on the success of the FORGE Librarian, I will start dedicating time to research and prototype new AI-driven solutions that can provide a competitive advantage, improve developer experience, or streamline operations across the platform.
- **Defining and evangelizing platform-wide engineering standards.** Using my deep expertise in technologies like ArgoCD and Kyverno, I plan to start formalizing best practices and policies that can be adopted by other teams, helping to improve consistency, security, and efficiency across the entire engineering organization.
#### **Stop Doing**
- **Acting as the sole owner of critical infrastructure components.** To improve team resilience and create growth opportunities, I will actively delegate ownership and responsibilities for systems like our ELK stack and Artifactory. While I will continue to provide oversight, I will stop being the single point of failure and instead focus on ensuring knowledge is distributed throughout the team.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Driving Project Success by Leading a Critical Team on the FORGE Program
**Accomplishment:** I stepped up on short notice to take on the anchor role for what is arguably the most critical team on the FORGE program, Rise8’s biggest and most strategic project. In this leadership position, I have guided our team's most important architectural decisions, led technical implementation, and fostered collaboration across the program.
**Impact on Rise8's Mission:** My leadership directly ensures that Rise8 is successfully delivering on its commitments for our most important client. By guiding this team, I am at the forefront of **continuously delivering valuable software** and executing the complex **digital transformation** that Rise8 promises. My willingness to step into this role when needed demonstrates a commitment to mission success above all else.
### 2. Setting the Strategic Foundation for the FORGE Cloud Architecture
**Accomplishment:** I spearheaded the highly successful kickoff for the FORGE program, where I facilitated a complex and critical conversation about the cloud environment's architecture. By analyzing thousands of pages of documentation, I was able to define a clear path from the current state to a modern, scalable future-state architecture.
**Impact on Rise8's Mission:** This accomplishment is a prime example of how Rise8 helps clients **modernize legacy systems**. By establishing a sound architectural strategy from day one, I de-risked the program and set the foundation for long-term **operational excellence**. This strategic foresight ensures the platform we build is robust, secure, and sustainable, reflecting Rise8’s reputation as a top-tier IT consultancy.
### 3. Championing Innovation with the AI-Powered FORGE Librarian
**Accomplishment:** I conceived and created the FORGE Librarian, an AI-powered tool that provides a common, accessible knowledge base for the entire program. This was a proactive initiative to push forward the company's "AI First" mentality and solve a critical information-sharing bottleneck.
**Impact on Rise8's Mission:** The FORGE Librarian is a tangible demonstration of Rise8’s commitment to innovation and **operational excellence**. By leveraging AI to make our own team more efficient, I am building the exact kind of innovative culture and capability that we advocate for with our clients. This initiative not only improves our internal delivery but also serves as a powerful case study for how Rise8 uses cutting-edge technology to solve real-world business problems.

This year, he successfully stepped into a Team Lead/Anchor role, where he demonstrated great versatility by helping his PM develop project plans and user stories, while effectively leading high-level conversations with other delivery leads and external stakeholders.

Your willingness to proactively lead, pair with others, and ask insightful questions elevates everyone. Above all, continue to be that crucial voice that seeks to learn and then advocate for what is best for our clients, the company, and the human beings on our team.




You are already operating at an extremely high level as a leader *within* our team. The clear next step is to **start** formally scaling that influence *across* the wider organization. Look for opportunities to take your proactive leadership and advocacy to a bigger stage—whether that's by leading a cross-team technical initiative, mentoring folks in other departments, or presenting your strategic insights on client/company needs to senior leadership. Thanks for all you do!
