### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> To move to the next level of performance, shift from a reactive to a proactive mindset:
- Stop waiting for formal assignments. While you efficiently handle defined tasks and tickets, a hallmark of leadership is the ability to independently identify high-impact problems.
- Instead of merely responding to defined tasks or tickets, use your increasing understanding of our strategic landscape and the Cyber Team's vital mission to proactively suggest improvements for the team and its deliverables..
I’d like to see you proactively shaping the work. This means identifying and addressing systemic security gaps, process inefficiencies, or potential vulnerabilities *before* they manifest as critical issues. This forward-looking approach is essential.




Recommendations for Scaling Impact and Demonstrating Leadership (Next Year Focus)
1. Develop and Mentor Future Contributors:
   - Start mentoring Developing Contributors on the team. Utilize your expertise to guide their development, helping them improve their quality standards, execution efficiency, and overall understanding of best practices. This direct contribution to the growth of your teammates is a critical aspect of leadership.
2. Champion Strategic, Mission-Critical Initiatives:
   - Start using your expertise to champion a new, mission-critical internal initiative for the Cyber Team. This could involve developing a novel security standard, automating a complex manual process, or designing a new architectural pattern. This exercise will allow you to move beyond execution and begin setting strategic direction and defining best practices, which is characteristic of the next level of performance.
3. Assert Confidence and Influence Strategic Discourse:
   - Start believing in yourself and your expertise as a recognized top practitioner..
   - Start using your voice to challenge the status quo directly and assertively in strategic discussions. Even in uncomfortable or high-stakes situations, assert your well-reasoned perspectives to drive better security and operational outcomes.
4. Proactively Showcase Leadership and Deliver Production Outcomes:
   - Start identifying new opportunities to demonstrate Outcomes in Production outside of your primary core assignment. Seek out and lead solutions for adjacent problems.
   - Proactively champion those solutions, taking ownership from concept to deployment. Showcasing this initiative and successful deployment of outcomes will solidify your leadership potential and readiness for the Team Leader role.

**Comment**:
> Pedro, you're only getting started! 




Your transition from cautious about using Gemini to treating it as a powerful problem-solving tool shows the kind of growth trajectory that will take you far. I've appreciated your clear, direct communication style and how easy you are to work with as a teammate. As you continue with the Cyber team, remember to embrace how we work at Rise8, including the discomfort that comes with trying new things.




Your teammates support you, and you have the skills and resilience to handle whatever challenges come your way.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start:** letting your curiosity drive your work even more intentionally. You've shown you can comply with rules AND explore the "why" behind them, so keep pushing that balance. When you encounter a new requirement or process, ask yourself "What problem is this solving?" and "What other approaches might work?"
- **Stop:** giving yourself less credit than you deserve. Own your wins of all magnitudes.
- **Keep:**
   - drawing on multiple approaches to solve problems, such as your Gemini work
   - communicating clearly and directly with your teammates
   - building others up through your collaborative spirit and willingness to hold down the fort when needed
   - becoming even more comfortable making mistakes during the learning journey. You're more equipped to handle struggles than you might realize, and each mistake is data that accelerates your growth.
