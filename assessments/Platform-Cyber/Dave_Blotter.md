**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I am confident I would be enthusiastically rehired. Over this review period, I have focused on defining the IT Services MVP, implementing the project's core IT systems, and helping to create and guide the process and structure for our IT functions.




My value has gone beyond these core tasks. I've demonstrated this by proactively analyzing program-level risks in the FORGE PWS and by playing a critical role in defining the MVP scope, which brought essential clarity to our team's objectives.




I've also shown a strong aptitude for learning to meet critical needs, actively developing new skills in Ansible coding, GitLab CICD, and prompt engineering to strengthen our automation. I've used this experience to be a collaborative team member, providing technical oversight and mentorship to elevate our team's overall competence.




I am fully committed to this team's success and am eager to align my engineering and planning skills to have an even greater impact in the coming year.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Based on my goals, I plan to make the following adjustments:
- **START:** I plan to **start** actively seeking projects that leverage my background in systems engineering and software integration. I want to **start** applying my skills as a leader and planner to contribute to broader program goals, which is where I feel I can add the most value.
- **STOP:** I plan to **stop** focusing exclusively on generalist IT support tasks. While I will always support my team, I want to transition away from being in a role that is not a strong long-term fit for my technical background. As part of this, I believe a transition from the FORGE project to a role with better alignment would be mutually beneficial.
- **KEEP:** I will **keep** being a collaborative and supportive teammate. I will **keep** focusing on my professional development as an engineer and technologist, and I will **keep** looking for ways to elevate the skills and confidence of those around me.
I look forward to discussing how I can continue to grow and add value to the team.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **De-risking Program Delivery Through Strategic Analysis:** I proactively initiated and delivered a comprehensive analysis of the FORGE Managed IT Services program. I synthesized complex contractual documents (PWS), operational plans (roadmaps), and SLOs to identify high-impact risks to sustainable delivery, including staffing, 24/7 on-call, and scope-creep. This analysis provides leadership with a clear feasibility assessment and actionable recommendations, ensuring our team's long-term health and our ability to reliably deliver on our contractual commitments to the customer.




**Enabling Secure Velocity with IAM Automation (IaC):** I demonstrated adaptability and initiative by quickly learning IaC to author and implement automation for IAM user management. This directly supports Rise8's mission by replacing a manual, error-prone process with one that is fast, repeatable, and secure. The impact *is* a significant increase in provisioning speed, a reduction in manual toil, and a strengthened security and compliance posture for the program.




**Establishing the Foundation for Delivery (MVP Scope):** I played a critical role in defining the IT Services MVP scope by translating broad PWS requirements into a concrete, phased set of tasks and foundational processes. By mapping our team's activities to contractual obligations, I established the initial framework for core services. This work was essential for bringing clarity to our team's objectives, unblocking them from analysis paralysis, and enabling them to begin delivering value to the customer.

### Question 11
**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> You took the initiative to dive deep into complex topics like Ansible, Kerberos, and IDM integration, effectively laying the foundational architecture for automated user management. You consistently apply technical expertise with an architectural mindset and proactively define team governance and best practices (e.g., drafting the team's code review process and coding standards).

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Continue driving the development of complex, centralized automation (Ansible/IDM): This is your biggest technical win. You are successfully building automation for user provisioning, monitoring, and reporting and integrating ITSM with IAM workflows.
- Elevate cross-functional influence by proactively managing technical relationships: As the anchor, you should be the proactive force that inspires cross-team collaboration and builds those relationships before you need something from them. You've noticed that sometimes it feels like the team gets "cold shouldered". To mitigate this, try taking the lead in reaching out early and often. Instead of letting others be the ones to send meeting invites, try taking the action item yourself so you can ensure it gets done on the timeline you want.
- Target documentation and analysis for impact, not output: Your ability to deep-dive and attention to detail is amazing. We have a difference in opinion on this, but I believe the resulting documents should be concise and targeted to the audience to ensure they are consumed and acted upon, especially in a timely manner. Part of the Sr. Information Technologist role is to adapt messaging to different audiences and influence team direction with compelling rationale.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Keep Doing:**




- **Providing exceptional support and motivation to the team.** Your consistent encouragement, not just to me but to other team members like Ann, fosters a positive learning environment and builds confidence across the team.
- **Challenging the status quo by asking critical, hard questions.** This intellectual curiosity is invaluable; it directly drives innovation and ensures we are creating necessary, impactful change rather than settling for outdated processes.




**Stop Doing:** 




- **Allowing past experiences to prematurely influence negative initial opinions of new processes or environments.** While your previous experience is valued, I think that you should prioritize **going with the flow** and maintaining an open perspective. Focus on **learning the current dynamics** before forming conclusions, leveraging your observational skills to adapt and contribute effectively.




**Start Doing:**




- **Increasing visibility by taking more active face time in demonstrations and presentations.** Actively seek opportunities to lead demos for both internal and external stakeholders. This will allow you to share your technical knowledge, build confidence, and gain exposure across the broader organization.

**Comment**:
> Dave embodies the value of Do What is Required by taking the time to deep-dive into critical project and contract documentation—such as the PWS, White Paper, and MDPAF guides. This ensures that he, and the team, are not just working hard, but working on the right things that align with our contractual commitments.
Dave also champions Do What Works through his focus on automation, specifically utilizing Ansible for user creation and onboarding, and his creation of high-value documentation (IRP, platform best practices). Culturally, he exemplifies Keep It Real and Be Bold; he provides timely, critical feedback to leadership regarding potential risks, demonstrating a strong desire to protect the mission and ensure the program’s success.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep working closely with leadership and other delivery teams. Your initiative to schedule meetings for quick reviews and feedback loops is vital.
- Keep voicing your thoughts and concerns. In our idea meritocracy, your perspective is essential for identifying risks early. Ensure your voice continues to be heard so we can navigate challenges and find success together.
- Keep working closely with your PM and leadership regarding roles and responsibilities, and prioritization of tasks. By ensuring work is documented and aligned with the project plan, you help the team avoid ambiguity and focus on delivering outcomes.
