For this year, FORGE secrel team gave a functional v1 of the pipeline on FORGE contract within the 180 day brand promise. There were missing features that were discovered later, but we are proud of the speed we delivered this pipeline in. The second big accomplishment is the modular pipeline where all the work for integrating SonarQube, Gitlab, OWASP, and Trivy are productizable and transferable to other contracts. Finally, creating and managing the backlog and planning for SecRel team while our new PMs are being spun up.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Andrew Knife:**
Schuyler is a thoughtful engineer who brings an experimental mindset and strong interpersonal skills to the team. His work on compliance tooling  and willingness to explore new approaches demonstrates curiosity and adaptability, while his open and honest communication style creates a positive team environment.

**Michael Estoy:**
Schuyler, working with you daily has been full of immersion in technical leadership and strategic thinking. During our team's formation, you immediately established our communication channels, set up our GitHub issue tracker, created team pairing rooms that became a portfolio-wide practice, and gathered the components we needed to start experimenting locally. Your bias toward action set the foundation for our success.




Your prioritization has kept our team afloat while navigating staffing challenges, shifting portfolio objectives, and evolving client needs. You help the team focus on what truly matters, such as valuing developer experience improvements over optimizations because you recognize where the greatest value lies. Your ability to acknowledge client needs and orient our work toward the highest-value outcomes keeps us aligned with our mission. The kudos from the retro board capture it perfectly: your ruthless prioritization, your focus on MVP, and your fearlessness in tackling the unknown are exactly what this team needs to deliver.

**Chris Brodowski:**
Schuyler is utterly brilliant, but unlike some others with his intellectual and technical talent he is extremely well-organized and never loses sight of the big picture.  He has exceptional leadership skills and is unafraid to speak his mind and stick up for his team no matter what the audience.  He has an extraordinary ability to communicate low-level, detailed engineering concepts to a higher-level, big-picture audience without losing sight of correctness or viewpoint.  He holds us accountable but will also hold himself accountable.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
Schuyler operates as a complete technical leader who delivers impact far beyond his immediate engineering tasks. He doesn't just deliver code; he derisks the entire architecture through rigorous validation. Beyond his exceptional engineering skills, Schuyler acts as a true force multiplier, stepping up to build the initial backlog and upskill the Product Manager on core agile practices. He balances deep technical rigor with cross-functional enablement, elevating the entire team's maturity.

**Ashley Pearce:**
Schuyler is absolutely an A Player in every aspect. His knowledge goes far beyond what is required and he is always willing to step up and pair to teach when necessary.

**Pedro Torres:**
Schuyler is one of the engineering anchors in the company. He's sought out for his expertise in complex software engineering and architecture. Schuyler is comfortable communicating potential roadblocks/concerns with leadership so they are informed of potential issues that may impact deliverables. "A" player

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Andrew Knife:**
KEEP DOING:
✓ Experimental approach to learning new tools - your curiosity and willingness to try things drives innovation
✓ Thoughtful contributions to team discussions - your perspective adds valuable context and consideration
✓ Willingness to help teammates - this collaborative spirit strengthens the team
✓ Appropriate boundary-setting with team processes - your feedback helps maintain healthy team norms




START DOING:
→ Sharing learnings from Nucleus experiments more broadly - document and present what you're discovering
→ Taking on more visible leadership opportunities - you have the interpersonal skills and technical capability to lead initiatives
→ Documenting development flow improvements - your work on hardening the dev flow would benefit from documentation
→ Mentoring more junior team members - your thoughtful approach would help others grow
→ Provide more frequent, specific, and relevant feedback - your role as the anchor engineer gives you insight into the things teammates are doing well and not doing well, help them to understand those areas.




STOP DOING:
✗ Nothing significant to stop - you're a solid contributor with strong trajectory

**Michael Estoy:**
- **Start**: expanding your strategic vision beyond our product and into portfolio and program-level initiatives. The FORGE program needs your architectural thinking and ability to navigate complexity at scale. Your vision can enable much larger, more complex enterprises.
- **Stop**: immediately judging ideas as "correct" or "wrong" when teammates share them. The team values exploring topics together to reach the best end state, and premature judgment can stifle that collaborative discovery process. Consider asking questions about how someone arrived at their thinking rather than assessing correctness upfront.
- **Keep**: acknowledging client needs and orienting the team toward our greatest value contribution. Your focus on developer experience over technical optimization is an example of this value-driven thinking.

**Chris Brodowski:**
Start: Would be nice to pair with him more?
Stop: Can't think of anything.
Keep: Keep doing what you're doing.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
- **Start** positioning yourself as the focal point for strategic technical conversations. The next step in your leadership journey is to move beyond execution and become the primary influence for clients and stakeholders on technical direction. Start actively leading the dialogue on security and architecture constraints, ensuring that you are not just implementing their technical requests but guiding them toward the right technical decisions.
- **Start** actively shaping the strategy at the portfolio level. You have mastered the technical challenges within your immediate team. The next step in your growth is to lift your head up and define the broader platform strategy. Start identifying which of your architectural patterns should be standardized across the wider organization and actively advocate for those decisions in cross-team forums.
- **Consider** the impact of your executive presence during client interactions. As a technical leader, you are a visible representative of our brand. Be mindful of how you show up virtually, specifically your camera presence and active listening cues. Taking a beat to fully listen and digest a client's comment before responding will demonstrate composure and build deeper trust with stakeholders.
- **Consider** how to institutionalize the practice improvements you have made. You have worked with all engineers to improve standards. Ensure these improvements are documented or codified so the high standard remains consistent for the team, even if your focus shifts to new challenges.
- **Keep** bridging the gap between Engineering and Product. Your initiative to upskill the PM on backlog management, story pointing, and story writing has not only improved the team's immediate workflow but elevated the overall practice maturity. This cross-functional leadership is highly valued.
- **Keep** navigating complex technical assignments to derisk delivery. Your work validating the team's output is a critical safeguard for the product direction. Your ability to handle these rigorous challenges ensures resilience where it matters most.

**Ashley Pearce:**
Keep being an amazing team player. I love that you are always willing to drop what you're doing to pair and help figure out a situation. You're a huge team player and a big supporter of streamlining and that makes being on a team with you so much fun!

**Pedro Torres:**
keep doing what you're doing!
