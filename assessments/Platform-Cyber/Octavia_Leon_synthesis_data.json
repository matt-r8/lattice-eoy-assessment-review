  "start_stop_keep": "**Benjamin Alvarez:**\nKeep developing Technical skills learning coding, cloud computing principals, transitioning over to the faster contractor pace.\n\n**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nFor the next review cycle, your focus should strategically shift to leveraging this strong foundation to maximize your overall organizational impact, specifically through the following development areas:\n\n\n\n\nTo transition from high performance to truly Best in Grade work, you must adopt a more strategic and, at times, ruthless approach to prioritization. While your high-impact execution is celebrated, a key developmental objective is managing your bandwidth as a finite, precious resource.\n- STOP**:** Stop saying \"yes\" to every incoming task, request, or opportunity. While your current tendency shows commitment, passion and a willingness to challenge yourself. Ensure that you are not over loading yourself which can create a risk of diminishing returns.\n- START: Actively and strategically declining requests or proactively proposing a significantly reduced scope. This practice must be employed anytime the requested effort threatens to dilute the quality or delay the completion of your current, mission-critical assignments. Elevate your focus to what generates the most significant and sustainable organizational outcome.\n\n\n\n\nProactively Seek Clarity and Guidance: Accelerating Mentorship and Mission Alignment\nIn a high-agency environment, maximizing personal effectiveness requires proactively seeking knowledge and ensuring complete mission alignment, rather than struggling in isolation.\n- STOP: Viewing knowledge gaps, ambiguity, or unfamiliar territory as a challenge to be conquered alone. We are a team built on shared expertise.\n- START: Systematically and proactively engaging both your direct teammates and adjacent subject matter experts for accelerated mentorship and peer feedback. Utilize this process to fill critical gaps quickly and align your approach with proven best practices.\n- STOP: Tolerating any remaining ambiguity regarding the underlying \"why\" of a task. Acceptance of vague direction is a missed opportunity for strategic alignment. Instead, Be Bold\u2014a key tenet of our culture\u2014and ask precise, clarifying questions. Ensure you fully comprehend the strategic context and anticipated outcome to maximize your execution and overall mission impact.\n\n**Samuel McQueen:**\nI suggest Octavia keep learning as he has been doing and getting more experience in different capacities on the program.\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nKeep growing, learning, and working with the different teams to understand their cyber needs.\n",
