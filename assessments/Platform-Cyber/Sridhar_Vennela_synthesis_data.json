  "enps_comments": "**Kevin Nash:**\nSri consistently demonstrates the qualities of a high-impact team leader and forward thinking engineer.  He approaches every task with curiosity and excellence, producing high quality deliverables that not only meet the requirements but often expand the team's vision of what is possible.  \n\n\n\n\nHe has shown courage and innovation through his AI product demos and his initiate to create better developer experiences, such as local testing environments and improved tooling.  Even when stakeholders disagree, Sri remains composed and professional, balancing diplomacy with quiet determination to do what's right for the mission.\n\n\n\n\nWhile he tends to be more outspoken in internal team discussions than in stakeholder meetings, his candor and insight drive better decisions and help the team stay grounded in reality.  He's deeply thoughtful, continously learning (as seen in his proactive effort to learn Ruby), and an example of ownership and resilience.\n\n\n\n\nSri is one of those teammates who elevates the standard of work by simply how he approaches problems - with foresight, humility, and care for both people and outcomes.\n\n**Art Tovar:**\nI believe Sri is a valued team member who delivers good work. However, he must demonstrate more initiative and proactiveness to find more ways to deliver outcomes and challenge our stakeholder when needed. This growth is essential for him to show more ways to bring value to the customer beyond what the customer is asking.\n\n**Sharon Hamilton:**\nSri has grown as an A player significantly this past year. He's continued to develop his skills to better support evolving customer requirements and has shown improvement in providing feedback internally. He's been willing to adjust to difficulties with team turnover and scope changes and has been receptive to feedback while keeping a generally positive attitude.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Kevin Nash:**\nShare his forward looking ideas more directly with stakeholders, even when there's risk of disagreement.  His insights add long term value and should be heard at every level.  Continue to experiment with AI and developer experience improvements; these prototypes drive innovation across the team.\n\n\n\n\nDon't hold back strong technical perspectives in external meetings.  His input carries weight and can influence direction when voiced.\n\n\n\n\nContinue to deliver high quality work that exceeds expectations.\n\n**Art Tovar:**\n**Start** being significantly more vocal during meetings, especially those involving technical strategy or problem-solving. We know you have strong technical knowledge, but you must consistently demonstrate it to the team and stakeholders by providing your input and analysis, fulfilling the expectation to **Be Bold**\n\n\n\n\n**Keep** actively looking to try new technical approaches and solutions to deliver measurable outcomes. The initiative you showed with the initial AI work was highly valuable (embodying **Growth Mindset**), and we need you to sustain that effort. We value the new ideas and improved ways of working you bring.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop** letting our customer stakeholder dictate direction by simply accepting the status quo. I need you to actively challenge assumptions, provide expert input, and offer technical direction where appropriate. This is essential to ensure we are focused on **Do What Works** and delivering the highest value, rather than simply executing requests.\n\n**Sharon Hamilton:**\nI'd like to see you further develop your relationship with your PO and be more willing to advocate for your suggestions and findings. Continue developing your skills and pairing with teammates. Continue providing feedback and asking for input.\n",
