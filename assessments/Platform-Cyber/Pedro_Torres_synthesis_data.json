  "enps_comments": "**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nPedro consistently performs as a Solid Performer, reliably meeting A Player expectations and delivering high-quality work as a skilled practitioner. He quickly came up to speed after transitioning to the Cyber Team, proving he possesses the strong Growth Mindset and adaptability necessary to immediately become a reliable asset.\n\n**Octavia Leon:**\nPedro\u2019s been great to work with. He is dependable, proactive, and always willing to help when something comes up. He stays calm under pressure and finds practical solutions without overcomplicating things. He communicates clearly and consistently delivers quality work!\n\n**Samuel McQueen:**\nPedro has been a great addition to the FORGE Cyber team. He is always willing to jump in and contribute and does so at a high level. His willingness to learn things outside of his specific expertise and apply that in a way that adds value is second to none.\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nPedro is so great to work with. He is always willing to help out and pick up tasks. I genuinely appreciate having him on the team.\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\nPedro, you're only getting started! \n\n\n\n\nYour transition from cautious about using Gemini to treating it as a powerful problem-solving tool shows the kind of growth trajectory that will take you far. I've appreciated your clear, direct communication style and how easy you are to work with as a teammate. As you continue with the Cyber team, remember to embrace how we work at Rise8, including the discomfort that comes with trying new things.\n\n\n\n\nYour teammates support you, and you have the skills and resilience to handle whatever challenges come your way.\n\n**David Croney:**\nI worked only briefly with Pedro, from what I understand he has a solid understanding of the cyber processes and goals needed to help FORGE be successful. He contributed quickly to the team and I was able to see him make progress by doing what works, what is required and take ownership of the necessary cyber tasks. I didn't have the opportunity to see his performance in other areas.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nTo move to the next level of performance, shift from a reactive to a proactive mindset:\n- Stop waiting for formal assignments. While you efficiently handle defined tasks and tickets, a hallmark of leadership is the ability to independently identify high-impact problems.\n- Instead of merely responding to defined tasks or tickets, use your increasing understanding of our strategic landscape and the Cyber Team's vital mission to proactively suggest improvements for the team and its deliverables..\nI\u2019d like to see you proactively shaping the work. This means identifying and addressing systemic security gaps, process inefficiencies, or potential vulnerabilities *before* they manifest as critical issues. This forward-looking approach is essential.\n\n\n\n\nRecommendations for Scaling Impact and Demonstrating Leadership (Next Year Focus)\n1. Develop and Mentor Future Contributors:\n   - Start mentoring Developing Contributors on the team. Utilize your expertise to guide their development, helping them improve their quality standards, execution efficiency, and overall understanding of best practices. This direct contribution to the growth of your teammates is a critical aspect of leadership.\n2. Champion Strategic, Mission-Critical Initiatives:\n   - Start using your expertise to champion a new, mission-critical internal initiative for the Cyber Team. This could involve developing a novel security standard, automating a complex manual process, or designing a new architectural pattern. This exercise will allow you to move beyond execution and begin setting strategic direction and defining best practices, which is characteristic of the next level of performance.\n3. Assert Confidence and Influence Strategic Discourse:\n   - Start believing in yourself and your expertise as a recognized top practitioner..\n   - Start using your voice to challenge the status quo directly and assertively in strategic discussions. Even in uncomfortable or high-stakes situations, assert your well-reasoned perspectives to drive better security and operational outcomes.\n4. Proactively Showcase Leadership and Deliver Production Outcomes:\n   - Start identifying new opportunities to demonstrate Outcomes in Production outside of your primary core assignment. Seek out and lead solutions for adjacent problems.\n   - Proactively champion those solutions, taking ownership from concept to deployment. Showcasing this initiative and successful deployment of outcomes will solidify your leadership potential and readiness for the Team Leader role.\n\n**Octavia Leon:**\nKeep doing what you\u2019re doing your technical depth, consistency, and attention to detail make a big impact on the team. You approach problems methodically and always make sure any issues are addressed the right way. I\u2019d say start sharing more of your insights with the team syncs or retros so others can learn from your process. You\u2019ve got a lot of knowledge that could help elevate the whole team\n\n**Samuel McQueen:**\nI suggest Pedro keep learning and applying himself the way he has since he came onto Rise 8 and the FORGE program.\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nKeep pushing to learn more! Using prodev to further skills in cyber, RMF and ATOs is a huge step in the right direction. Don't be afraid to take initiative on tasks and lead them to the end.\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\n- **Start:** letting your curiosity drive your work even more intentionally. You've shown you can comply with rules AND explore the \"why\" behind them, so keep pushing that balance. When you encounter a new requirement or process, ask yourself \"What problem is this solving?\" and \"What other approaches might work?\"\n- **Stop:** giving yourself less credit than you deserve. Own your wins of all magnitudes.\n- **Keep:**\n   - drawing on multiple approaches to solve problems, such as your Gemini work\n   - communicating clearly and directly with your teammates\n   - building others up through your collaborative spirit and willingness to hold down the fort when needed\n   - becoming even more comfortable making mistakes during the learning journey. You're more equipped to handle struggles than you might realize, and each mistake is data that accelerates your growth.\n\n**David Croney:**\nI don't have enough experience or observations with Pedro to priovide accurate insight here.\n",
