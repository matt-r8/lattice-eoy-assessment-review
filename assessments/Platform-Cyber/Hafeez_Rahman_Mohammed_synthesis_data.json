  "accomplishments": "1. I proactively took on **Team Lead responsibilities** when the role was vacant, providing essential technical guidance and direction. This move was crucial for **maintaining team stability and velocity** during a difficult transition period, allowing me to advise our new Project Manager on key technical decisions and ensuring our work remained aligned with project objectives.\n2. I led the effort to **mentor new engineers** following the contract transition, quickly establishing myself as the reliable resource for historical context, architecture, and process knowledge. By accelerating their onboarding and ensuring the effective **transfer of critical institutional knowledge**, I significantly boosted the team's overall productivity and resilience.\n3. I championed and drove foundational **technical debt work** that directly boosted platform stability and observability. This involved leading complex research (SPIKEs), creating the resulting backlog of tasks across multiple sprints, and actively working on these tickets while **unblocking and assisting teammates**, resulting in a more reliable and secure base for future development",
  "enps_comments": "**Kyle Dozier:**\nHafeez and I have worked side-by-side for over half a year now on the VA contract, weathering the storm together. I still haven't had many opportunities to pair, due to both of us trying to stay focused on our own work and help out the other engineers, but I have continued to appreciate his unwavering and consistent contributions to the team. He has repeatedly reached out for feedback, and clearly take an action and improved on that feedback. I've seen him grow to be more outspoken in meetings, speaking his mind, even when it's uncomfortable. His insights and feedback are always appreciated.\n\n**Noah McHugh:**\nA great year of growth for you, can't wait to see what you do next year.\n",
