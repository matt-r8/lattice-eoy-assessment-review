  "enps_comments": "**Benjamin Alvarez:**\nSamuel has been huge help in providing customer engagement experience and Documentation reviewing support\n\n**Tiyyiba Zahid:**\nI agree Sam has been an incredible teammate who brings both technical excellence and a positive, solutions-focused attitude. They\u2019re dependable, collaborative, and always willing to jump in to help others. Their contributions made a real difference to our team\u2019s success and morale.\n\n**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nSam has recently joined a highly challenging and demanding program, and it is clear that he is currently struggling to find his footing and integrate effectively into the rigorous environment. While his potential is recognized, his current performance demonstrates a significant gap between the expected standard and his delivered work.\n\n\n\n\nA primary area for immediate and substantial improvement is taking full ownership of his work. This goes beyond simply completing assigned tasks; it requires a deep commitment to quality and self-accountability. Sam must rigorously adopt a process that includes a comprehensive self-review cycle for all deliverables. This means critically assessing his own work for errors, incompleteness, and misalignment with the project's objectives *before* submitting it for review.\n\n\n\n\nThe expectation for anyone in this program, and especially for those aspiring to be \"A Players,\" is the consistent delivery of high-quality, final results. Currently, Sam frequently submits work that is incomplete, lacks necessary depth or polish, or requires substantial corrective action from supervisors or teammates.\n\n\n\n\nTo transition into a high-performing \"A Player,\" Sam must immediately cease the practice of submitting work that is less than the expected high standard. He needs to internalize the fact that his submissions must be \"plug-and-play\" ready, demonstrating thoroughness, attention to detail, and a complete understanding of the assignment's requirements. This change in approach is critical for his success and is a non-negotiable step toward meeting the program's demanding performance benchmarks.\n\n**Octavia Leon:**\nSam's jumped in from the VA contract and filled a last minuted vacated position like he\u2019d been here the whole time. He adjusted fast, brought a ton of technical knowledge, and handled everything with professionalism and drive. He\u2019s dependable, hardworking, and always stays locked in on getting the job done right. You can tell he takes pride in his work, and the team\u2019s been stronger with him on board.\n",

Sam's consistency and support make a huge difference in team morale and success.\n\n**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nContinue Doing\n- Exemplary Collaboration and Demeanor: You consistently embody the core value of \"Always Be Kind,\" setting an exemplary standard for teamwork and maintaining a kind and collaborative demeanor.\n- Boosts Team Morale: Your positive and upbeat presence is a significant asset, greatly enhancing overall team health and morale.\nAreas for Improvement (Stop Doing)\nTo elevate performance and impact, you must immediately address issues related to quality and ownership.\n- Stop Submitting Incomplete/Low-Quality Deliverables: You must cease treating tasks as complete when the quality is deficient or the work is only partially done. This directly hinders the team's ability to demonstrate Outcomes in Production.\n- Stop Dropping Ownership Prematurely: You must stop relinquishing ownership the moment a task is no longer in your immediate focus, as this forces teammates to expend unnecessary effort in chasing down closure.\nDevelopment Recommendations (Start Doing)\nFor the upcoming year, your focus must be on cultivating end-to-end ownership and accountability for all assignments.\n1. Institute 100% End-to-End Ownership: You must commit to taking full responsibility for your assignments from initiation through final adoption.\n2. Implement Rigorous Self-Review: Start rigorously testing and reviewing your own work to ensure high quality before any handoff. A Solid Performer reliably meets expectations without requiring correction.\n3. Ensure Mission Impact and Close the Loop: Start closing the loop with both the team and the customer to verify the work has been fully adopted and is achieving the desired mission impact. This is the mechanism for demonstrating that you Do What is Required.\n4. Embrace Challenges as Learning Opportunities: Start seeing challenges in quality or execution as opportunities to learn and grow, rather than as reasons to complain or give up, reinforcing your Growth Mindset.\n\n**Octavia Leon:**\nKeep doing exactly what you've already been doing by showing your technical skills, professionalism, and ability to adapt quickly have been a huge asset to the team. You consistently deliver high-quality work and handle challenges with a calm, solutions-focused approach. The way you jumped in and filled the gap without missing a beat really showed your dedication and capability. Keep that momentum going for you\u2019re  already setting a great example for all of us on cyber as a whole.\n",
