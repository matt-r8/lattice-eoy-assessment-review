**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I **Strongly Agree** with this statement. My teammates would enthusiastically rehire me because I'm a **reliable, proactive team member** who focuses on stability and shared knowledge, especially when things get constrained or complex.




I consistently act as an **unblocker and mentor**. I prioritize helping others through dedicated pairing sessions, for instance, assisting with issues like the monitoring work. This ensures the team maintains momentum and keeps our technical capability high.
I take **ownership of stability and risk**. During periods like the code freeze, I pivoted to lead key work like our whole **monitoring setup**, improving our platform visibility and health. I'm dependable in quickly addressing support requests. Although some days I might have lacked behind in some of my responsibilities but I learn and strive to be better. Right now, myself and the fellow Riser on the team(Kyle) are the **only** **key reliable players consistently driving the work forward**.




Finally, I lead crucial **Knowledge Transfer (KT) efforts**. I ensured vital process knowledge was shared and documented through sessions like the deployment demo for Deloitte. This makes me a trusted **source of information** and strengthens the whole team.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> As this month marks my first year on the VA contract and on Rise8, I'm focusing on solidifying my role as a key contributor and knowledge resource.
- **START:** I plan to **proactively acquire deeper and broader knowledge of the entire VA platform and its underlying infrastructure.** My goal is to become the primary **knowledge and information resource** for the organization, allowing me to foresee architectural conflicts and better inform strategic decisions. I will also start formalizing my mentorship by taking ownership of the onboarding process for new engineers.
- **STOP:** I will continue to reduce time spent on **reactive firefighting** by consistently improving our monitoring and observability tools. I plan to stop accepting technical debt that compromises stability without clearly defined plans for remediation.
- **KEEP:** I will **continue demonstrating and performing the full responsibilities of a senior engineer**, focusing on unblocking teammates, driving high-impact technical initiatives, and owning platform stability. I will **keep serving as a reliable mentor** and technical partner for the team, focusing on skill-sharing through pairing sessions and thorough knowledge transfer.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. I proactively took on **Team Lead responsibilities** when the role was vacant, providing essential technical guidance and direction. This move was crucial for **maintaining team stability and velocity** during a difficult transition period, allowing me to advise our new Project Manager on key technical decisions and ensuring our work remained aligned with project objectives.
2. I led the effort to **mentor new engineers** following the contract transition, quickly establishing myself as the reliable resource for historical context, architecture, and process knowledge. By accelerating their onboarding and ensuring the effective **transfer of critical institutional knowledge**, I significantly boosted the team's overall productivity and resilience.
3. I championed and drove foundational **technical debt work** that directly boosted platform stability and observability. This involved leading complex research (SPIKEs), creating the resulting backlog of tasks across multiple sprints, and actively working on these tickets while **unblocking and assisting teammates**, resulting in a more reliable and secure base for future development

**Comment**:
> Hafeez and I have worked side-by-side for over half a year now on the VA contract, weathering the storm together. I still haven't had many opportunities to pair, due to both of us trying to stay focused on our own work and help out the other engineers, but I have continued to appreciate his unwavering and consistent contributions to the team. He has repeatedly reached out for feedback, and clearly take an action and improved on that feedback. I've seen him grow to be more outspoken in meetings, speaking his mind, even when it's uncomfortable. His insights and feedback are always appreciated.

**Rating**: None - Unknown
