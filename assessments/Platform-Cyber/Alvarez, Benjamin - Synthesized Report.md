**Jeremy Steinbeck:**
While Ben has a solid foundational skill set and a willingness to learn the primary concern is the gap between effort and delivered outcomes. To be an A Player, results must be consistent. Currently, execution and communication gaps frequently introduce unnecessary risk and impact our team's ability to demonstrate Outcomes in Production. Ben needs to take greater ownership of the full cycle of work, from acceptance through to communicating the final impact.

**Samuel McQueen:**
Ben is a rising star within Rise8, his technical knowledge and dedication to the success of the program is outstanding. He consistently takes on difficult, and thankless task that enables the team to work efficiently and provide outcomes to the customer.

**Octavia Leon:**
Ben’s been crushing it as an ISSE on the cyber team showing up strong and putting his technical skills to work to get the FORGE cyber environment fully dialed in. He’s always willing to jump in, troubleshoot, and share knowledge to help others get unstuck. His willingness to mentor and support anyone who asks really stands out, and it’s clear he takes pride in elevating the whole team, not just his own work. Ben brings the right mix of technical depth, initiative, and teamwork exactly what you want in a senior engineer.

I would like to see Ben be more involved within Rise8 so everyone can appreciate his work ethic and knowledge.
