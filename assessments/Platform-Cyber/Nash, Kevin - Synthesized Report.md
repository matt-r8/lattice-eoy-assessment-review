<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

Developed a monitor snapshot, comparison and restore toolkit enabling safe, automated visibility into monitor changes across the VA ecosystem.  It introduced timestamped snapshots, diff-based change tracking, deleted monitor recovery, and dashboard generation for both triage and error tracking giving Watchtower full traceability and data integrity for all Datadog monitors, preventing loss of critical configurations and laying the groundwork for reliable repeatable observability analytics across VA systems.  




Developed the Datadog Alert Summary Reporter, a system used to generate weekly, monthly, and lifetime enhanced reports for leadership.  It transforms raw Datadog event data into structured, priority-aware markdown reports, automatically categorizing monitors by team, service, and behavior (expected/transient/defect).  The system made recurring alert patterns, flappiness, and ownership measurable shifting Watchtower from reactive alert review to proactive reliability analysis.  




Developed a triage report generator, automating daily Watch workflows.  It creates ready-to-use triage reports with monitor context, Slack messaging templates, and issue linking for recurring alerts.  This helps teams resolve issues faster and streamlines communications allowing those on the Watch the ability to focus on other tasks.
