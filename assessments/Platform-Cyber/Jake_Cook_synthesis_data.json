  "employee_name": "Jake Cook",
  "accomplishments": "1. In a matter of weeks, I brought deep domain expertise into multiple FORGE teams and helped guide the focus and efforts towards the customer's needs and expectations, which has already been very well received. This was achieved through SME Office Hours hosted of my own volition.\n2. Successfully demo'd some system services to the customer and received excellent feedback.\n3. Architected a code sharing solution to unblock the FORGE Tiger Team (FWS) development needs using standard git tooling (patches/bundles). This has allowed our team to develop code more traditionally and succeed in delivering our first demo while reducing risk & duplication of efforts when migrating to IL5 GitLab in the future.",
  "enps_comments": "**Kevin Gates:**\nJake has been invaluable as a teammate, bringing not just deep domain knowledge, but solid engineering skills.\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\nJake made a huge impact from day one. He jumped right in, setting up office hours for the whole Rise8 FORGE team to ask questions and quickly organized knowledge transfer sessions on key FORGE topics. His system for sharing git files was especially valuable, making it much easier for the team to collaborate and stay sane. It\u2019s been great working with him!\n\n**Adam Gardner:**\nJake, I know you've only been here for four weeks, but that's been more than enough time to make a significant positive impression. This 'end-of-year' feedback is less about 'past performance' and more about solidifying those first impressions and setting a trajectory for a successful next year.\n\n**Asare Nkansah:**\nAlthough Jake has only been on the team for a short time, I have been very impressed with his contributions and attitude. He possesses solid technical skills and a clear drive to see our mission succeed.\n\n\n\n\nWhat has been incredibly valuable is his preexisting knowledge of FORGE from his time at SDL. More importantly, he has shown a great willingness to share that knowledge with the entire team and is a fantastic teacher, with a real skill for communicating complex ideas clearly. He consistently takes the initiative to leverage his unique experience and find ways to make an impact on the broader program. Based on this very strong start, I have seen nothing but positive contributions from him.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Kevin Gates:**\nKeep: Bringing deep domain knowledge and making it relevant. Being very helpful in translating complex technical issues into plain english. Being calm when things don't go perfectly, pivoting and keeping the ball moving. Paring effectively and sharing what he knows.\nStart: Jake has showed some interest in more product-like activities. If the opportunity presents, it would be great to have Jake be a part of more balanced team activities that blur lines between engineering, product and design.\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\n- Start: Keep looking for ways to break down barriers and connect the team, both technically and through communication. Initiatives like your git setup and office hours really raise the bar.\n- Stop: Nothing comes to mind.\n- Keep: Continue pushing for practical solutions and supporting team knowledge sharing. Your drive to improve how the team works together is making a clear difference.\n",
