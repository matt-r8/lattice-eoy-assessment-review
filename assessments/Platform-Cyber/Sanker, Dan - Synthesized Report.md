### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with accomplishments text]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

- I am exceptionally proud of the secure and efficient Path-to-Production pipeline our team delivered for the RAD platform. This solution provided consistent documentation, non-repudiation, and clear approval recording from development through production.****  This directly empowered both App Dev and Cybersecurity teams to operate with significantly greater confidence and clarity, reducing friction and accelerating their ability to deliver value securely.
- I am currently helping break new ground for the Space Force and Palantir by building a "first-of-its-kind" pipeline to deploy third-party apps into an ATO'd environment. I successfully demoed our initial capability to the PMO and other key stakeholders, fielding their questions and validating our technical approach.  This demo secured stakeholder buy-in and built the confidence needed for the program to move forward, positioning Rise8 as a key innovator capable of solving novel, high-stakes challenges for our clients.
- This year, I committed to expanding my technical and procedural expertise by successfully obtaining three new certifications: two in Azure and the ITIL Foundations certification.  This directly enhances Rise8's credibility and our collective ability to deliver expert, modern solutions to our clients, particularly in critical cloud (Azure) and service management (ITIL) domains.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Chris Johns:**
I would enthusiastically recommend rehiring Dan Sanker for his role on the team. Dan is an exceptional technical strategist and platform engineer who not only delivers complex infrastructure components but also provides critical, high-level analysis regarding the project's ATO process.
- Dan delivered complex, foundational infrastructure required to support multi-tenant onboarding and worked relentlessly to overcome environment blockages.
- After extensive troubleshooting and iteration, Dan achieved the critical milestone of getting the Bifrost GitLab instance up and running. This allowed the team to start testing in Apollo for the first time.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Dan is an extremely committed practitioner who always keeps the long term goals of the project in mind.  When everyone is down in the weeds, Dan has an eye on the overall process and the decisions that will bite us later.  He brought a unique mix of context, experience, and technical experience to the project which he has shared generously with our team of app developers.

**Steven Souto:**
Dan consistently brings his best effort and breezy attitude every day. Very focused and interested in all meetings and pairing sessions, asks great questions, and maintains a very humble attitude to problem solving. Dan takes the lead in lots of different areas whether engineering or product and is a very good at communicating complex subjects.

**Delaney Coveno:**
Dan is a leader on the Bifrost team - he is kind, approachable, easy to work with, and a great problem solver. He is comfortable letting others lead while also taking on a lot of leadership himself - being the technical spokesperson in external meetings and also making sure our architecture and priorities are driving the team in the right direction.

**Bryce Nguonly:**
Its really impressive how you can think at multiple different levels all the time. Your ability to zoom out from the detailed engineering work, and relate it an effort that might affect our ATO package is incredible. It helps someone like me bridge the gap between the two efforts that are brand new to me.

**Jeremy Viray:**
Dan is an exceptional engineer who brings a depth of experience and clarity to the team. He’s the champion of avoiding unnecessary rules and complexity, if something doesn’t make sense, he’s never afraid to challenge it, and that skepticism is incredibly valuable in the environment we’re navigating. As we build Bifrost and work toward achieving an ATO, his ability to cut through noise, question assumptions, and steer us toward pragmatic solutions has been instrumental. Dan’s perspective helps ensure we focus on what truly matters.

**Kenny Slater:**
Dans calm presence and hard working attitude makes it a pleasure to be on his team. When there was a chance at losing him to a different team I was nervous for the impact the team would feel. I have never once questioned if Dan was working hard.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Dan. Even without working directly together, I’ve seen how effectively he bridges conversations between cyber, engineering, and development teams. His thoughtful questions, innovative ideas, and ability to lead discussions—especially during the successful customer demo—showcase both technical depth and professionalism that elevate the entire team.

**Clark Pain:**
I have thoroughly enjoyed working with Dan and really value the skills and experience he's bringing to the team.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Chris Johns:**
Keep Doing:
- Keep driving the strategic imperative of automating security and compliance as the core value proposition.
- Keep advocating for the platform team's needs and technical best practices in external communications.
Start Doing:
- Start formalizing the long-term architectural solution for compliance artifact storage and retrieval.
- Start implementing and testing foundational operational stability processes.
Stop Doing:
- Stop committing development work directly to the main branch. I am joking a little bit here. This is something that Dan has been advocating for. Honestly, I cannot think of anything Dan should stop doing.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Start: Building confidence with facilitation.  It seems like you often have a vision, and you put it out there and fight for it, but I don't know if you're strategically building alignment around your ideas.  If interested, this might help gather team momentum and build confidence with stakeholders.  




Continue: Watching out for the details or opportunities to improve that others miss.  Even in a big team like Bifrost (maybe especially in a big team) some ideas get lots of traction and others are less developed.  You seem to be looking out for processes / conversations / goals that will benefit Bifrost and the Bifrost team.

**Steven Souto:**
I think Dan should start developing more of a toolbox for engineering facilitation. He's a great contributor to technical discussion but I've only seen a few examples of ownership over a complex engineering document. We are working on a number of complex systems in Bifrost and we could very much benefit for more people owning and facilitating the development of high fidelity diagrams or process maps to enable better communication across the engineers. Perhaps also start involving yourself or initiating more conversations with product to push forward story development. I'm loving your focus this week on having an MVP discussion.




Keep engaging with all facets of the product team and not just silo'ing your efforts to engineering. This is such a great skill and Dan excels at it, often contributing meaningfully to discussions of product and vision and direction. Dan also has a keen sense of when to ask "what are we doing and why?" which he should keep doing. Dan also has a great energy and style that keeps things light yet motivated and is consistent at sharing positive feedback. I would love to get more critical feedback from Dan actually.

**Delaney Coveno:**
- Start: I would be interested to hear more of Dan’s perspective gained from past experience, since he has more platform experience than most of the team. Especially during team discussions.
- Stop: Working all day without a break!
- Continue: Being principled when developing our architecture. Being open to all ideas and being comfortable to pair with. Making sure other's voices are heard.

**Bryce Nguonly:**
Start:
- Documenting your thoughts and opinions through story generation. I think that you have a really good grasp for what is required of Bifrost. Our team would really benefit if you took an active role in determining what stories actually need to be created and how they fit into the larger epics they are apart of. 




Continue:
- creating internal team efforts in transforming our teams processes. From creating the onboarding/front door guide to a more transparent external questions forum, we benefit a lot from these upgraded internal processes. 
-  bridging engineering efforts to relate to our mission. It really helps us connect our stories to the greater mission outcome. After meetings with stakeholders, you always evaluate the current state of work and compare it to the course of actions we identified.

**Jeremy Viray:**
You consistently embody the values of doing the right thing and doing what works, definitely keep that up. One area I’d love to see you lean into even more is experimentation: being open to testing ideas earlier rather than spending too much time searching for the perfect solution upfront.

**Kenny Slater:**
Start: I believe your experience in the field and in the company makes you a great candidate to backfill the team loss with Graham leaving. I would recommend that you take those unwritten leadership roles he was filling to facilitate the teams path forward.




Stop: This isn't so much as a "stop" as it is a recommendation. It killed me to see how well you did on the customer facing demo, and then fumble a little when it was time to show Rise8. I think it was because you were trying something new to make the demo even better, so maybe rehearsing the new tool prior to showing the company. I have a feeling that whatever the issue was is fixed by now though because you are an A player.




Keep Doing: Bringing your leadership and experience into our day to day operations. The team takes your advice very highly.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
**Keep:** Engaging across disciplines and bringing forward clear ideas and insights. Your ability to connect different perspectives, ask meaningful questions, and represent the team confidently in customer interactions makes a significant impact.

**Clark Pain:**
I appreciate how you've stepped up to help lead the engineering team with Graham's departure and have helped align the team behind the product vision, keep it up! I think you could keep growing in this role both internally and externally. I also would like to see you help lead the development of the big picture and overarching technical strategy as you grow into this role.
