  "employee_name": "Chris Brodowski",
  "accomplishments": "- Built our team's full suite of both SAST (SonarQube) and DAST (OWASP Zap) on the FORGE SecRel pipeline from start to finish.  This includes: 1) developing, testing and implementing source code on our CLI; 2) building, provisioning and hardening for security each of the Docker containers; and 3) Writing the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests to deploy the contents onto OpenShift.  Along the way, I built from source, with no support from the vendor, a much more secure version of SonarQube than the vendors themselves have ever released.\n-  Answered the call numerous times to operate outside of my comfort zone for both personal growth and for the benefit of the company.  I took on Product Manager duties (running our daily standups), I took on Client Liason duties (serving as assistant to Brittany Sailors with NIPR/SIPR outreach and scheduling until I was asked to stand by), I offered my services as an platform interview consultant and I was one of the first at Rise8 to push Mike Gehard's ClaudeAI devcontainers to their potential (and unintentionally costing more compute dollars than anyone else in that initial demonstration!)\n- I have worked on maintaining SecRel's deployment of Nucleus Security.  I have generated a detailed set of documentation on both procedures and recommendations for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Nucleus Security and implemented that into our pipeline, which included submitting the documentation to FORGE Cyber and receiving a favorable review.  Nucleus Security will be the primary methodology for mitigating/enforcing vulnerabilities for the FORGE program and I have gleaned significant experience in it.",
  "enps_comments": "**Andrew Knife:**\nChris demonstrates exceptional grit and growth mindset as a newer team member tackling complex technical challenges. His persistent work on container deployments with security constraints shows determination and resilience. His collaborative approach and willingness to learn from more experienced teammates positions him well for continued growth.\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nChris is a phenomenal Riser who puts everything he has into his work.\n\n**Schuyler Reinken:**\nChris began performing almost immediately after he was hired. He goes straight for the hard things that have to be done and does not stop until he conquers them. He's a joy to pair with and a boon to our team. Only issue is that there are times he should probably stop what he's doing to re-evaluate if it is worth continuing. If there's a particularly thorny issue that you expend every last ounce of brain power you have over 2 weeks, but it wasn't worth that kind of effort, or the team needs to review if we need to be doing something different, stopping and checking in might benefit him and the team as a whole.\n\n**Sean Herbert:**\nOutcomes in production hasn't been meet on the FORGE program due to delays in obtaining DAF Cloud Works accounts.\n\n\n\n\nChris is a very strong performer despite having many life challenges this year. He's work is always of very high quality and delivered on time.\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nChris is really passionate about the projects he works on. I've witnessed Chris research and pair with other engineers to find solutions to challenging issues. He's an absolute \"A\" player.\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\nChris, your contributions to Team CyberSecRel represent some of the most complex technical problems we have faced. Your work on Nucleus integration, SonarQube hardening, and OWASP ZAP implementation has improved security posture while reducing time-to-release and time-to-onboard. These are technical wins that are force multipliers because they enable other teams to deliver value faster.\n\n\n\n\nWhat stands out most is your ability to persist through frustrating technical challenges. When you tackled the Nucleus API integration or rebuilt SonarQube multiple times, you brought humor and maintained team morale throughout. That combination of technical grit and positive energy is rare and valuable.\n\n\n\n\nI also appreciate how you extend grace and support to teammates during their learning journeys. You create space for others to experiment and make mistakes, which builds psychological safety for the team.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Andrew Knife:**\nKEEP DOING:\n\u2713 Persistent problem-solving on complex technical issues - your determination is impressive and drives results\n\u2713 Seeking help from more experienced team members - this accelerates your learning and demonstrates good judgment\n\u2713 Taking on challenging infrastructure work - you're building valuable skills and delivering impact\n\u2713 Leading stand-ups when opportunities arise - continue developing leadership skills\n\n\n\n\nSTART DOING:\n\u2192 Sharing learnings with broader team - present at show-and-tells or write documentation\n\u2192 Taking on more leadership opportunities - continue stepping into leadership roles like stand-up facilitation\n\u2192 Pairing with others to share knowledge gained - as you master concepts, help others learn\n\u2192 Contributing to architectural discussions - bring your perspective and questions to technical planning\n\n\n\n\nSTOP DOING:\n\u2717 Being so hard on yourself - you are an instrumental part of the team and everyone appreciates the work you do to support outcomes!\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nKeep doing everything you're doing! Keep learning and pushing forward.\n\n**Schuyler Reinken:**\n- Keep doing fantastic work! Chris's tenacity is his best feature\n- Start deliberately pairing more. Chris needs to prevent his own burnout by leveraging pairing more effectively\n- Start documenting / communicating more. Chris can multiply the impact of his efforts by presenting them to the team more or documenting it so all that knowledge becomes widely shared.\n\n**Sean Herbert:**\nStart: Learning and delivering on AI as this has been identified as a company priority. \n\n\n\n\nStop: Trying to over explain everything. You have gotten a lot better and realize that this is a personality characteristic that makes you enjoyable to work with, but remember to just dial it up or down as needed. \n\n\n\n\nKeep Doing: Working your way to becoming a team anchor or team lead. I really believe you would do great, especially with all the volunteering you do for hosting standup. I understand this may not happen until your personal life doesn't stay as crazy as right now.\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nKeep doing what you're doing!\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\n- **Start:** allowing yourself to make more mistakes in the learning journey. You're already excellent at this with teammates, so please extend that same grace to yourself. Experimentation means some paths won't work out, and that's valuable data, not failure.\n- **Stop:** dismissing incremental progress because you haven't reached the final goal yet. Each step forward is a win worth acknowledging, whether it's understanding a new API endpoint, getting one format working, or eliminating one possible solution. These small victories compound into the major achievements your peers recognize you for.\n- **Keep:** persisting through frustrating technical challenges while maintaining your sense of humor. Your ability to stay the course when technology fights back is a strength. Your combination of determination and levity during standups keeps the team energized even during difficult sprints.\n",
