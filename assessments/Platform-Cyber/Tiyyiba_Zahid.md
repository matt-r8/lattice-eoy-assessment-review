### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **AFWERX Contract**
As part of the AFWERX engagement, I played a key role in guiding multiple application teams through the RMF process, translating complex DoD compliance requirements into clear, actionable steps tailored to their engineering workflows. Our team’s collaborative approach helped one application achieve an Interim Authorization to Test (IATT) before contract closeout, demonstrating measurable progress toward secure deployment. The AFWERX customer expressed strong appreciation for our partnership, emphasizing their desire to continue the engagement due to the value and clarity we brought to their authorization efforts. The customer was very happy with the work we did on the contract. 




**Advanced Professional Development** 
I invested significantly in my professional growth this year. I earned industry-recognized certifications including CISM and AWS Solutions Architect – Associate, and recently began studying for my Certified Kubernetes Administrator (CKA) certification. These credentials enhanced my ability to bridge technical depth with security governance, contributing to more credible and informed engagements with customers and engineering teams. I also attended a Women in Cybersecurity conference, gaining valuable insights, mentorship, and connections within the broader security community.




**Team Engagement**
Beyond project work, I contributed to Rise8’s culture by helping organize the company offsite, joining the swag team, and leading the Paint & Sip class and Unconference session. These efforts strengthened team connection, creativity, and alignment with Rise8’s values of collaboration, growth mindset, and fun, fostering the type of culture that fuels our mission-driven delivery.

**Comment**:
> Being from the engineering side, I admittedly dont get as much natural interaction to the compliance/cyber side as I would like to. Its something that I wish our team tapped into more, cross functional activities/learnings with the infosec analyst. 
Despite not having much daily interaction, its very comforting to know that the ATO portion of Bifrost is in good hands and that you are actively keeping up to date with those discussions, documentation, and onboarding materials.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Its valuable when you do speak up during engineering heavy discussions. I think that your opinion holds a lot of weight because of your insight on whats required from an engineering perspective. 
It would also be cool to get share outs of what have been researching/working on. Just like how theres engineering share outs, if you learn/document anything worth noting, you should schedule a small share out after standup. I think it would really help the team keep up to speed on all facets of Bifrost.

> Tiyyiba has been a true force multiplier for our team. Her impact is clear and significant. Coming from another program, she has brought a deep understanding of the company landscape and a powerful network of relationships.
She consistently knows who to talk to across the organization to get things done, which is an invaluable skill that accelerates our entire team's progress.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> Start:
I would strongly encourage you to start proactively inserting your voice and opinions into our team meetings. Your insights on our work and your knowledge of the organization are critical, but I fear that I and others sometimes talk over you because you tend to wait for a clear opening. Please start claiming that space in the conversation, even if it means interrupting—your perspective is too valuable to miss.
Stop:
Stop waiting for that 'perfectly defined opening' to join a conversation. We need your voice and your ideas in real-time, so I'd love for you to stop hesitating and just jump in.
Keep:
Keep being that force multiplier. Absolutely keep leveraging your cross-team relationships and organizational knowledge. That skill is a unique and powerful asset that helps our whole team succeed.

**Comment**:
> Tiyyiba initially joined the team as surge support, and we've been very lucky to have her, where now it would be very difficult for the team if she left. She has been instrumental in creating documentation needed for our ATO package, pulling together the application team SSP template and getting it filled out by the Surefire team in an incredibly short amount of time. She also created a Trello board for security onboarding, which she's been able to share with other teams outside of Bifrost for RMF context. She's been very proactive since joining the team, and has been someone we can lean on for compliance expertise.

> - **Keep** expanding your cybersecurity expertise - the team will be leaning on you and Kenny more, especially with Graham's departure, so it's a great opportunity to increase your scope of impact. 
- **Keep** looking for ways to ease some of the eventual documentation building that's coming for accreditation. You're already doing this, and it will definitely help to have some of it off your plate when it's crunch time.
