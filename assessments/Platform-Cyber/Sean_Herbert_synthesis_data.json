  "employee_name": "Sean Herbert",
  "accomplishments": "1. Starting the initial development of an AI tool to assist FORGE cybersecurity on doing their RMF work by generating documents such as Plan of Actions and Milestones (POAM) and Security Assessment Reports (SAR) and even asking a chatbot certain key questions regarding RMF using NIST documents. \n2. Developing tools for the SecRel pipeline on FORGE to meet Minimal Viable Product (MVP) goals. Those tools include Cosign, parallel container building, OpenSCAP scans that run in parallel, and virus scanning with ClamAV. \n3. Developing the initial ideas of how to have FORGE tenants run the SecRel pipeline and inspiring the idea of moving towards Alpine Linux for the base image of all our containers. \n4. Deploying SD Elements, I put this last because I don't know how this will be used in FORGE, I overhear it's not something required for this program.",
  "enps_comments": "**Schuyler Reinken:**\nSean is a highly capable team member that we can always depend on. In addition to always being ready to tackle the challenges that pop up on our team, he has explored AI integrations that can pay off and deliver big outcomes in the future. As long as he communicates effectively the work that he does, he'll continue to thrive.\n\n**Andrew Knife:**\nSean is an aolid contributor who exemplifies innovation and mission focus. His leadership in developing the \"Checkm8\" agentic AI capability demonstrates boldness, technical excellence, and pragmatic product thinking. While this effort did not directly relate to the initial deployment of the project, it will be the cornerstone of work ahead on the project.\n\n**Chris Brodowski:**\nSean is a terrific guy to work with.  He is enthusiastic, personable and a hard worker.  He led the charge into AI for our group, developing an AI-based MCP server known as CheckM8 that can take the personas of a Cybersecurity Engineer, Product Manager and more.  He will explore any possibility and isn't afraid to learn or ask, and is honest and direct.  He will take on any challenge and is unafraid of anything.\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\nSean, your ability to pivot and reprioritize has been one of your greatest contributions. You've demonstrated flexibility by setting aside your passion project, CheckM8, to tackle MVP items like OpenSCAP integration, ClamAV, and pipeline infrastructure work. Without your willingness to shift gears and handle what the team needed most, we would be behind schedule, missing key security features, and operating with a weaker security posture.\n\n\n\n\nYour technical versatility is impressive. You've moved among complex AI development, pipeline engineering, security tool integration, and troubleshooting. The kudos from the team reflect this: \"shifting gears about 18,000 times a day\" and \"agility during shifting priorities\" are recognition of your ability to deliver across different problem spaces.\n\n\n\n\nWhat makes this even more valuable is that you think strategically. Your unconventional thinking and ability to rally the team, like getting everyone behind the CheckM8 name, show leadership qualities that go beyond individual contributor work.\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nSean is wonderful to work with. I believe he is a great asset on the FORGE team and has a passion and drive that a lot of Risers would be lucky to have.\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nSean is a sought-after engineer that can break down complex architecture and easy to understand. He works well with others and look forward to continue working with him.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Schuyler Reinken:**\nKeep: engaging in various things to help the project. Your multitasking ability continues to drive outcomes\nStart: Communicating any changes that have big design implications beforehand. Large refactors need to be shared in case it affects other scripts or other subtle pieces of the overall pipeline.\n\n**Andrew Knife:**\nKEEP DOING:\n\u2713 Driving innovation with AI capabilities - your leadership on Checkm8 is transformative for the mission\n\u2713 Helping teammates with technical challenges - your willingness to support others amplifies team effectiveness\n\u2713 Pragmatic approach to implementation and costing - this ensures sustainable, production-ready solutions\n\u2713 Excellent communication about progress and blockers - your transparency enables team coordination and support\n\u2713 Growth mindset and continuous learning - you're constantly expanding capabilities and applying new technologies\n\u2713 Product thinking - considering the full lifecycle from development to adoption to maintenance\n\n\n\n\nSTART DOING:\n\u2192 Documenting AI/ML learnings for the broader Rise8 community - your expertise is valuable organization-wide\n\u2192 Considering how to scale your innovation approach - how can you help others innovate similarly?\n\u2192 Building more formal feedback loops for Checkm8 users - systematic feedback will accelerate iteration\n\u2192 Sharing your journey at more company-wide forums - your story could inspire innovation across Rise8\n\u2192 Mentoring others interested in AI/ML - develop the next generation of AI practitioners\n\u2192 Product thinking - considering the full lifecycle from development to adoption to maintenance and how our current work relates to the end state\n\n\n\n\nSTOP DOING:\n\u2717 Taking on too many concurrent initiatives - while you handle multiple workstreams well, consider focusing to increase individual impact and avoid burnout, this also flows into your git hygeine. Too many \"features\" in your working branch can be detrimental when it comes time to merge the changes.\n\n**Chris Brodowski:**\nKeep: Pairing with us.\nStart: Can we find a way to pair re: CheckM8 again?  \nStop: Can't think of anything.\n\n**Michael Estoy:**\n- **Start:** \n   - specializing in one of your new areas of expertise and leading it end-to-end. You've built a strong foundation across AI, pipeline engineering, and security tooling. Now is the time to go deeper in one domain and deliver not just functional solutions, but polished, refined work that showcases the finer points of your craft. Consider which area energizes you most and where you can create the most strategic impact and then own it completely.\n   - cultivating an inner dialogue that reminds you of your goals and capabilities rather than your perceived shortcomings. When you catch yourself downplaying an accomplishment, like the intrinsic value of CheckM8, pause and reframe: What would you think if a teammate had built this? You undersell yourself, and shifting that internal narrative will unlock your next level of growth and impact.\n- **Stop:** letting self-limiting beliefs cloud your perspective on your contributions and accomplishments. Your work speaks for itself, from building CheckM8 from scratch to rescuing critical pipeline issues to integrating complex security tools. Trust in the evidence of what you've delivered and the feedback your teammates give you.\n- **Keep:** taking initiative to advance our mission, especially when no one volunteers. This quality is invaluable to the team. Your willingness to step up to SDE setup that \"wants to fight you every step of the way\" or working through OpenSCAP \"like a Rocky movie\" keeps us moving forward when others might hesitate.\n\n**Ashley Pearce:**\nDon't be afraid to reach out to SMEs to get more advice on the things you're building. User interviews are a great tool when building a product for a specific domain.\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nLeadership, PM.\n",
