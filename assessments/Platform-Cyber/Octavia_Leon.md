**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would rehire me because I consistently deliver measurable impact and embody our core values of Grit and Growth Mindset. I've been instrumental in pushing forward critical compliance work, specifically owning and driving the complex NOVA MVP SD Elements tagging to nearly 90% completion, which is foundational for our Phase 1 delivery and Authority to Operate (ATO).
Beyond technical delivery, I've proven to be a highly effective and supportive collaborator. I proactively reach out to other teams and regularly join syncs to provide helpful feedback that accelerates the team's path toward authorization. My willingness to learn and "unquestionable" productivity make me a reliable, efficient, and valued member of the FORGE cyber team. My communication is concise and I show initiative by identifying and highlighting areas for process improvement to better support future Risers.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start- Shift from simply identifying blockers to proactively raising, framing, and socializing potential high-impact risks (e.g., ATO timeline impacts, control gaps) with the entire cross-functional team (Platform, Developers, Government stakeholders).




Stop- Stop focusing solely on the *completion* of a technical task in isolation. Instead, make the effort to document the "why" and "how" of the solution upon completion to build shared team knowledge and reduce future technical debt.




Keep- Maintain the strong work ethic and deep ownership
Continue proactively syncing, asking clarifying questions, and extending support to peers and partners.
Maintain the unquestionable desire to learn the fastest by actively seeking out new challenges and feedback to continuously deepen your technical and process insight.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### Driving Foundational Compliance for Critical Mission Delivery
Accomplishment: Took full ownership and drove the complex, foundational task of tagging activities in SD Elements for the NOVA MVP, achieving 80-90% completion for tenant-responsible tasks.
Mission Impact: This diligent work was instrumental in defining security requirements and creating the core Risk Management Framework (RMF) documentation (System Security Plan/SSP). By front-loading this compliance, I directly accelerated the team's time-to-authorization (ATO) for the NOVA MVP, which is a core value proposition of Rise8's continuous delivery model.




Proactive Cross-Functional Collaboration to Unblock Delivery
Accomplishment: Proactively collaborated and paired with other FORGE teams (Platform, PM/Anchor) and regularly joined client syncs to align cyber deliverables for the ATOs. I also leveraged my background to avoid schedule slips and worked with government stakeholders.
Mission Impact: This commitment to collaboration and knowledge sharing accelerated our team's velocity and time-to-value. By helping the team get "creative about how to accelerate our time to authorization", I directly reduced the biggest vulnerability in any system: time.




### Demonstrating Rise8 Core Values & Team Improvement
Accomplishment: Consistently exhibited Grit and a Growth Mindset by diving into large, complex tasks and actively seeking out opportunities to learn and sync. I provided clear and actionable feedback to the onboarding team to help better support future Risers and identify key blockers, embodying the principle of continuous improvement.
Mission Impact: I've served as a valued member and positive indicator of success, directly contributing to the organizational health that allows Rise8 to scale its impact. By improving the internal onboarding process, I've reduced the ramp-up time for new hires, which is a measurable operational metric essential for a my role as a cybersecurity engineer.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For the next review cycle, your focus should strategically shift to leveraging this strong foundation to maximize your overall organizational impact, specifically through the following development areas:




To transition from high performance to truly Best in Grade work, you must adopt a more strategic and, at times, ruthless approach to prioritization. While your high-impact execution is celebrated, a key developmental objective is managing your bandwidth as a finite, precious resource.
- STOP**:** Stop saying "yes" to every incoming task, request, or opportunity. While your current tendency shows commitment, passion and a willingness to challenge yourself. Ensure that you are not over loading yourself which can create a risk of diminishing returns.
- START: Actively and strategically declining requests or proactively proposing a significantly reduced scope. This practice must be employed anytime the requested effort threatens to dilute the quality or delay the completion of your current, mission-critical assignments. Elevate your focus to what generates the most significant and sustainable organizational outcome.




Proactively Seek Clarity and Guidance: Accelerating Mentorship and Mission Alignment
In a high-agency environment, maximizing personal effectiveness requires proactively seeking knowledge and ensuring complete mission alignment, rather than struggling in isolation.
- STOP: Viewing knowledge gaps, ambiguity, or unfamiliar territory as a challenge to be conquered alone. We are a team built on shared expertise.
- START: Systematically and proactively engaging both your direct teammates and adjacent subject matter experts for accelerated mentorship and peer feedback. Utilize this process to fill critical gaps quickly and align your approach with proven best practices.
- STOP: Tolerating any remaining ambiguity regarding the underlying "why" of a task. Acceptance of vague direction is a missed opportunity for strategic alignment. Instead, Be Bold—a key tenet of our culture—and ask precise, clarifying questions. Ensure you fully comprehend the strategic context and anticipated outcome to maximize your execution and overall mission impact.
