## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Schuyler Reinken:**
Andrew's stellar performance is well known and widely appreciated. He can bounce between several tasks at once and drive outcomes in multiple dimensions. The only major growth point would be to make sure the code, Dockerfiles, and scripts are more modular enough and reusable. There are several instances of code being produced by AI several times, all slightly differently, creating the possibility for subtle issues and bugs.

**Michael Estoy:**
Drew, working with you daily has given me a front-row seat to your ability to see the big picture and anticipate how different factors affect our pipeline before anyone else does. You're our canary in the coal mine who spots issues like Artifactory file size limits that could make our pipeline inoperable. This proactive, systems-level thinking is invaluable.




You're a trailblazer who isn't afraid to lead into unknown territory. Whether it's automating runner creation or hardening our software supply chain, you take ownership of complex, ambiguous problems and bring them to the finish line. The kudos from our team retrospectives say it all: You're the Swiss Army Knife who shows up everywhere we need you most, from helping teammates debug typos to ensuring our pipeline infrastructure stays secure and operational.




What impresses me most is how you balance being a force multiplier for the team while maintaining focus through WIP limits. You've built trust to handle bigger challenges, and I'm excited to see you take on even more strategic, transformative work in the coming year.

**Chris Brodowski:**
I can't say enough about Drew so I will attempt to keep this focused.  Long story short, he is an absolute superstar in every way.  His technical skills, amiable personality, leadership mindset, ability to focus on both the fine details and long-term goals of the program as well as the mission of the company all at the same time is simply unbelievable.  In my opinion, he has outgrown his current rank.  It would be inconceivable to let a guy like this go after the conclusion of the FORGE program.  If he isn't an A Player, then I simply don't know what an A Player is...and I believe I know an A player when I see one.

**Sean Herbert:**
Outcomes in production hasn't been meet on the FORGE program due to delays in obtaining DAF Cloud Works accounts. 




Andrew has been an amazing team mate, he always assists in anyway he can and continues to be proactive in identifying problems and resolving them before customers or other members of the team identify them. Highly recommend for promotion over myself.

**Ashley Pearce:**
Andrew is a solid performer and an even better Riser. He strives to make the team better, is always willing to step up when necessary, and never complains even in the most stressful situations.

**Pedro Torres:**
Andrew brings a combination of a SME, leadership potential, easy to work with, and an absolute "A" player mentality to the table. He is frequently sought-after for complex engineering topics, and volunteers to lead projects, meetings, briefings, etc. Very happy to work alongside Andrew.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Schuyler Reinken:**
Keep: Generally being awesome
Stop: Working too many angles? Don't want you burning yourself out.
Start: Exploring more long term implications of the code produced. Just because it works doesn't mean it will always continue to work in all cases, and getting that closer to reality can produce big impacts.

**Michael Estoy:**
- **Start:** Taking even bigger risks and leading more strategic, program-level initiatives from conception to completion. You have the technical depth, systems thinking, and team trust to tackle the ambiguous and high-impact challenges. Don't wait for permission because you're already shaping direction.
- **Stop:** Limiting the size of your dreams and what you believe you're capable of achieving. Your track record proves you can own and deliver transformative solutions. Think bigger about the problems you want to solve and the impact you want to create.
- **Keep:** 
   - being our systems thinker who spots risks and opportunities before others do. Keep building automation that has strategic, program-level impact. 
   - being the teammate who shows up to help others while maintaining your focus on high-value work. 
   - elevating yourself and the entire team through your technical leadership and collaborative spirit.

**Chris Brodowski:**
Stop: I think he might be overextended a bit.  He might be taking on more things, both at Rise8 and elsewhere, that he should, and we want him for the long-term. This company should never, ever let him go.  
Start: Not sure what to put here.
Keep: He is excellent in pairing, always ready to help no matter what the need. Always ready to pitch in at a moment's notice.

**Sean Herbert:**
Start: Senior Platform or CI/CD Engineer




Stop: Sometimes you can be a little too hard charging and take away opportunities maybe others wanted to take on. This could be work tickets, presentations/ demos, etc. 




Keep Doing: Keep learning and asking for feedback, you seem very eager to improve anyway you can.

**Ashley Pearce:**
Keep doing everything you're doing! You are absolutely killing it and I couldn't be more excited to work alongside you.

**Pedro Torres:**
Leadership, PM opportunities
