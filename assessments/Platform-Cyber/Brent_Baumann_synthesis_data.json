  "accomplishments": "Successfully transitioned the program's Incident Response readiness from tabletop exercises to a full-scale functional exercise. I led the planning and execution of this first functional test, raising the bar for organizational preparedness and ensuring a repeatable, higher-fidelity standard for future continuity and response operations.\n\n\n\n\nConducted a comprehensive audit of the program's existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs), identifying critical gaps in clarity and performance measurement. I subsequently led the implementation of significant technical and policy revisions aimed at improving high availability and configuration optimization. This work was foundational to the design and deployment of a new SLA dashboard and monitoring suite, ensuring that our reporting now accurately reflects and supports the program's most critical infrastructure performance metrics\n\n\n\n\nI initiated a critical assessment, with Coty Allen, of the current architecture, identifying key areas for improvement and developing a forward-looking roadmap focused on scalability and resilience. To ensure continuous program success during this transition, I successfully collaborated with key individuals across teams to deploy a necessary interim solution, allowing us to address immediate operational needs while fully planning the comprehensive future architecture.\n\n\n\n\nThrough proactive technical leadership, I significantly elevated the program's operational maturity, directly supporting Rise8's mission to deliver high-quality, resilient production outcomes for our customers.",
  "enps_comments": "**Paul Fretz:**\nI haven\u2019t had the privilege of working extremely closely with Brent, but every time I do, I genuinely enjoy it. He\u2019s positive, easy to talk to, and great to partner with when solving problems. He has a vast amount of knowledge and skill, and I believe he\u2019ll be able to fully leverage and capitalize on that in his new role. I\u2019m confident he\u2019ll do great things, and I\u2019m excited to see it happen. He\u2019s calm under pressure and a truly pleasant person to pair with.\n\n**Ron Golan:**\nI really enjoy working with Brent. My biggest piece of constructive feedback, which I've given Brent directly, is to push harder to fix the problems that he's good at spotting. This can also mean influencing the customer to let him jump in and help, if thats what it takes.\n\n**Coty Allen:**\nI witnessed Brent persevere through tough program times where little guidance and feedback were given beyond,\" You're doing great work, keep it up.\"   It's always good to see someone not get disheartened when a program does that.\n\n**Jodie Nkansah:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Brent for his role, because he is an essential contributor who consistently leverages his influence for the benefit of the company and stakeholders. Brent has proven he is comfortable operating in roles with unclear boundaries and expectations. He excels in building strong relationships with stakeholders. He is also data-driven and uses data to work backwards from mission impact.\n\n**Luke Strebel:**\nTaking a high level about Brent, I've been always really impressed with him since the day he joined LHDI and Rise8. Comparing him and other engineers in the program, I felt like he was really easy to work with. He didn't only highlight problems but offered solutions and helped drive them through to completion. He also was just willing to take risks and be bold when there was no guarantee of success.\nFor example, stepping into the Chief Engineer role is a pretty big leap for him, not just in career progression, but also in exposure to risk. The platform is not 100% stable, so it could look poorly for Brent if things don't go well, and I think that would be extremely unfair. He's inheriting a lot of the mess that came before him, as well as entering in with zero turnover from his predecessor and tons of things to learn (how to keep the platform compliant, how to make sure it is working).\n\n\n\n\nHe has a huge challenge in front of him, and I've been really impressed with his energy and his willingness to ask questions and ask for support. I'm really happy that he's using Coty to help keep track of things and leaning on the engineers who are here now. The Tornado team was a little concerned after some of the platform team transfer meetings, feeling like they did not really know the platform as well as they should have, and that's just another highlight of the challenge Brent is going to have to overcome. Not many of the senior non-riser engineers are all-stars, and even they might be leaving. He just has to be extremely proactive in identifying risks and tracking them down and sharing them back to both Rise8 and our VA stakeholders.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Paul Fretz:**\n**Start** \u2013 I think some of Lighthouse\u2019s decisions are questionable at times. When something doesn\u2019t make sense, pushing back more\u2014*not just from you, but from all of us*\u2014could make a positive difference. You have leadership\u2019s ear, and they respect you immensely.\n**Stop** \u2013 I don\u2019t have anything I feel you should stop doing.\n**Keep** \u2013 You\u2019re a \u201cglass-half-full\u201d type of person, and I really appreciate that. I don\u2019t think Lighthouse fully utilized your potential previously, but I\u2019m glad to see you in your new role. I\u2019m excited to see what you accomplish in it.\n\n**Ron Golan:**\nStart: creating the situation you wish you were in (where reasonably possible), and stop accepting it as is (again, when reasonably possible). Keep confronting uncomfortable team situations when they arise - you're very good at that, and its a real strength.\n\n**Coty Allen:**\nKeep:  Building your experience with all the rules in the Government contracting space.   It's great to want to do more and work extra ours, but Government contracts are very explicite in SOW and the Hours your allowed to work.\n\n**Jodie Nkansah:**\nKeep exercising your strategic courage and integrity. Your skill and willingness to use data to initiate hard conversations surrounding programatic risks has been crucial for LHDI. Keep operating with high agency. Start sharing your high-quality feedback and insights proactively. While I have never directly received feedback from Brent, given his exceptional integrity and analytical rigor, his insights into individual's performance would be extremely valuable to teammates and leadership if share unsolicited.\n\n**Luke Strebel:**\nFor next year, the key actions are clear. Most importantly, **keep** that high-energy attitude up, and **keep** investing in your relationships with your leads, as this will be critical for managing your complex stakeholder environment. Please also **keep** finding ways to make our drum beat effective\u2014focusing on the *important* stories, not just a list. The main area to **start** is to be extremely proactive in identifying, tracking, and sharing platform risks with both me and VA stakeholders. Finally, **start** helping me find where outcomes are, even on other teams; just a \"hey, this team did something interesting\" is all I need, and I'm happy to help frame it from there.\n\n\n\n\nYou've had a great start to the role. Excited to see you grow your opinion and push back on some things around lhdi to make us successful!\n",
