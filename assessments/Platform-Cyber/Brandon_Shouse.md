**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> - The first quarter of the year was focused on wrapping up the KM contract strongly, applying company goals to ship outcomes to prod and doing right by the customer, with/ integrity by shifting as much knowledge as possible to the incumbent team and pairing with them until my last day on the contract
- The last three quarters have been on the FORGE contract. While we do not yet have a production environment and have had many roadblocks, I have worked hard to get as much done as possible without the accounts. Bringing several members of the team up to speed on some rather complex Terraform/Terragrunt capabilities, debugging OpenShift Cluster issues, and striving to build a platform that can support contract efforts for our customers there. 
- I feel I continue to provide extremely valuable insight in my areas of expertise and have removed several roadblocks for the team(s) over the last year, enabling us to go fast and learn more

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Start offering to pair more. I do pair and 100% willing to jump into a room to solve issues as they come up, but I am not proactively seeking pairing. This could be an area of improvement, especially when starting to drive on the real FORGE accounts.
- Keep pushing as hard as possible and within reason to get past roadblocks on our projects, realizing some things are in our control and others are not

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Wrapped up the KM contract, pairing with the incumbent team until my last day there. This makes other contractors want to work with us and sets a good example for future transitions. We all have had those transition experiences that were unpleasant.
- Innovated several aspects of the FORGE platform, which will be integral to its success. These show our customers that we have the technical know-how to succeed and continue to support day 2 OPs.
   - SSO w/ Keycloak that supports basic auth with OTP as well as CAC authentication
   - Identified several areas where our particular deployments were causing problems in our clusters, getting us past some recurring issues/outages
   - Knowledge sharing and leveling up the team via technical writing and demonstrations, enabling the team to go faster 
- At the start of the FORGE contract, while new folks were onboarding, handle some of the meetings and technical discussions with FORGE senior leadership.

**Comment**:
> Keep up the great contributions at FORGE and owning certain lines of work! Keep speaking up when needed for any risks/etc that arise--you do a solid job at that and you don't ever shy away which is always appreciated and valuable. I think my only suggestion would be to try and pair/KT your lines of work in the future. That will help with knowledge silos in the future when we need to fix things (or if you win the lottery!).

**Rating**: 3 - Neutral

**Comment**:
> I've selected "Neutral" because while Brandon possesses valuable skills, his level of engagement and presence on the team has been inconsistent.




On the positive side, Brandon is a very kind and nice person to work with. When he is engaged in a task, his technical skills are excellent, and his range of experience has been helpful to the program. I also appreciate that he is always willing to jump into the game and contribute when asked directly.




However, his frequent time off/absence in daily standups can make it challenging to maintain momentum and feel consistently connected as a team. This sense of disconnect is sometimes amplified by a perceived lack of engagement and smaller things, like keeping his camera off during meetings. My main wish is for him to become more proactively invested in the team's mission and take more initiative to jump into challenges on his own. While his skills are an asset, this proactive engagement is what's needed to elevate his impact from contributing to truly driving our team's success.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep being a kind and helpful teammate.** Your positive personality is appreciated, and your willingness to contribute when asked is a valuable asset.
- **Keep applying your technical expertise.** Your range of skills is a great benefit to the team when you are involved in a project.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start proactively seeking out opportunities to contribute.** Instead of waiting to be asked, begin looking for gaps or challenges where you can take initiative. This would demonstrate a deeper investment in our collective mission.
- **Start increasing your virtual presence.** A simple but impactful step would be to turn your camera on more often in team meetings. This helps build connection and shows you are present and engaged with the conversation and your teammates.




#### **Stop Doing**
- **Stop waiting for tasks to be directly assigned to you.** The team would benefit immensely from you taking a more proactive posture, identifying needs on your own, and jumping in to help solve them.

**Comment**:
> Brandon has established himself as a strong Sr PE on the program, consistently demonstrating the Grit and autonomy required to drive complex initiatives. He is a highly effective autonomous worker who leverages his experience from previous programs to quickly generate necessary artifacts without request, such as architecture diagrams and PPSM.
He has shown a willingness to take on substantial bodies of work—including our hardened image strategy, secrets management comparisons, backup strategies, and the Nessus/ACAS scanning solution. Crucially, Brandon embodies the value of Do the Right Thing; he proactively collaborates across teams like Cyber and SecRel to ensure solutions are architected correctly the first time, rather than rushing and creating debt that hurts us later.

> - Keep identifying areas in the development of ACDC where you can lead the charge. As a senior PE, use these opportunities to not just deliver outcomes, but to upskill your fellow teammates along the way, fostering a growth mindset across the team.
- Keep producing strong documentation. This is critical for our learning velocity. Your documentation serves as a guide for future iterations, enables new PEs to onboard quickly, and provides transparency regarding the "why" behind our architectural choices.
- Keep up the tight collaboration with other teams and your fellow Senior PEs / PM (Nick and Asare). The backlog is large and the team moves fast; continue working with your peers to spread the load effectively so we can maintain speed without sacrificing quality.
