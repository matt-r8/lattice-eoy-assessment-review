**Comment**:
> Celebrating my one year anniversary, I reflect on a period of significant adjustment and growth. Getting familiar with government contracts, coordinating diverse contractor teams, and navigating two major personnel transitions presented considerable challenges. It is clear that success in this complex environment hinges on embodying the Rise8 traits. While I actively demonstrate these traits, I am committed to refining my application of them further.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> In my new role on the program, I will be taking a more proactive leadership stance, focusing on establishing a clear strategic direction and systematically removing roadblocks for our platform engineering teams. A key initiative will be to stop accepting how things have been done by previous personnel and to challenge the status quo by actively proposing and implementing alternative solutions when legacy processes impede progress. I remain committed to maintaining high impact communication across individuals, teams, and key stakeholders to ensure alignment and transparency.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Successfully transitioned the program's Incident Response readiness from tabletop exercises to a full-scale functional exercise. I led the planning and execution of this first functional test, raising the bar for organizational preparedness and ensuring a repeatable, higher-fidelity standard for future continuity and response operations.




Conducted a comprehensive audit of the program's existing Service Level Agreements (SLAs), identifying critical gaps in clarity and performance measurement. I subsequently led the implementation of significant technical and policy revisions aimed at improving high availability and configuration optimization. This work was foundational to the design and deployment of a new SLA dashboard and monitoring suite, ensuring that our reporting now accurately reflects and supports the program's most critical infrastructure performance metrics




I initiated a critical assessment, with Coty Allen, of the current architecture, identifying key areas for improvement and developing a forward-looking roadmap focused on scalability and resilience. To ensure continuous program success during this transition, I successfully collaborated with key individuals across teams to deploy a necessary interim solution, allowing us to address immediate operational needs while fully planning the comprehensive future architecture.




Through proactive technical leadership, I significantly elevated the program's operational maturity, directly supporting Rise8's mission to deliver high-quality, resilient production outcomes for our customers.

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start** – I think some of Lighthouse’s decisions are questionable at times. When something doesn’t make sense, pushing back more—*not just from you, but from all of us*—could make a positive difference. You have leadership’s ear, and they respect you immensely.
**Stop** – I don’t have anything I feel you should stop doing.
**Keep** – You’re a “glass-half-full” type of person, and I really appreciate that. I don’t think Lighthouse fully utilized your potential previously, but I’m glad to see you in your new role. I’m excited to see what you accomplish in it.

**Comment**:
> I really enjoy working with Brent. My biggest piece of constructive feedback, which I've given Brent directly, is to push harder to fix the problems that he's good at spotting. This can also mean influencing the customer to let him jump in and help, if thats what it takes.

### Question 12

**Comment**:
> Start: creating the situation you wish you were in (where reasonably possible), and stop accepting it as is (again, when reasonably possible). Keep confronting uncomfortable team situations when they arise - you're very good at that, and its a real strength.

> I would enthusiastically rehire Brent for his role, because he is an essential contributor who consistently leverages his influence for the benefit of the company and stakeholders. Brent has proven he is comfortable operating in roles with unclear boundaries and expectations. He excels in building strong relationships with stakeholders. He is also data-driven and uses data to work backwards from mission impact.

> Keep exercising your strategic courage and integrity. Your skill and willingness to use data to initiate hard conversations surrounding programatic risks has been crucial for LHDI. Keep operating with high agency. Start sharing your high-quality feedback and insights proactively. While I have never directly received feedback from Brent, given his exceptional integrity and analytical rigor, his insights into individual's performance would be extremely valuable to teammates and leadership if share unsolicited.

**Comment**:
> Taking a high level about Brent, I've been always really impressed with him since the day he joined LHDI and Rise8. Comparing him and other engineers in the program, I felt like he was really easy to work with. He didn't only highlight problems but offered solutions and helped drive them through to completion. He also was just willing to take risks and be bold when there was no guarantee of success.
For example, stepping into the Chief Engineer role is a pretty big leap for him, not just in career progression, but also in exposure to risk. The platform is not 100% stable, so it could look poorly for Brent if things don't go well, and I think that would be extremely unfair. He's inheriting a lot of the mess that came before him, as well as entering in with zero turnover from his predecessor and tons of things to learn (how to keep the platform compliant, how to make sure it is working).




He has a huge challenge in front of him, and I've been really impressed with his energy and his willingness to ask questions and ask for support. I'm really happy that he's using Coty to help keep track of things and leaning on the engineers who are here now. The Tornado team was a little concerned after some of the platform team transfer meetings, feeling like they did not really know the platform as well as they should have, and that's just another highlight of the challenge Brent is going to have to overcome. Not many of the senior non-riser engineers are all-stars, and even they might be leaving. He just has to be extremely proactive in identifying risks and tracking them down and sharing them back to both Rise8 and our VA stakeholders.
### 
Looking at the formal rubric, Brent is **'Best in Grade'** in nearly every category. His decision to take the Chief Engineer role in a turbulent time is a perfect example of being **'Bold.'** He consistently **'Does the Right Thing,'** **'Does What Works,'** and **'Does What is Required,'** which he proved by jumping in for whatever he is needed, whether its to help pair on a Friday afternoon with SecRel or to sit in an all-dayer working through issues. He's **'Always Be Kind,'** investing in his relationships by asking about life outside of work and actually caring about the answers. His **'Grit'** was shown by sticking through ATTV, and his **'Growth Mindset'** is clear as he steps up in meetings and consumes platform knowledge. Finally, he's **'Best in Grade'** at **'No Unnecessary Rules,'** proving he can take charge without a predecessor, like setting up meetings with Stephen and Scott on his own. The two areas for growth are **'Solid Performer'** ratings. For **'Keep it Real,'** he is real with me, but the drum beat needs to be more formal to effectively communicate with Rise8 and stakeholders. For **'Outcomes in Production,'** he owned them in ATTV but didn't *share* them, and he needs to be invested in finding and surfacing platform outcomes so I'm not the only one. I would **'Strongly Agree' to rehire** Brent for this role.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For next year, the key actions are clear. Most importantly, **keep** that high-energy attitude up, and **keep** investing in your relationships with your leads, as this will be critical for managing your complex stakeholder environment. Please also **keep** finding ways to make our drum beat effective—focusing on the *important* stories, not just a list. The main area to **start** is to be extremely proactive in identifying, tracking, and sharing platform risks with both me and VA stakeholders. Finally, **start** helping me find where outcomes are, even on other teams; just a "hey, this team did something interesting" is all I need, and I'm happy to help frame it from there.




You've had a great start to the role. Excited to see you grow your opinion and push back on some things around lhdi to make us successful!
