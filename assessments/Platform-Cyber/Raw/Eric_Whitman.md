**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe I am a solid A Player on the FORGE team and my peers would enthusiastically rehire me. I contribute meaningful work and frequently am the one to speak up regarding risks and how to mitigate and think outside of the box, especially as it relates to surging forward in IL5. I have owned a couple lines of work on FORGE and have done KT sessions to try and make sure the team is aligned. I push the Rise8 culture and think of everything through that lens by always keeping the customer and our vision in mind.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - Owning more lines of work at FORGE and identifying areas on where we can improve. Truly take ownership of many pieces of the FORGE platform and do what it takes to get outcomes ASAP and hit our IL5/IL6 timelines, leading to customer trust and potential future opps. Become a SME on our FMDE-GCU and GCC platform.
Stop - Don't say Yes to everything and take on more than what I can to where it would impact the client work I am focusing on.
Keep - Continuing speaking up for risks that arise and coming up with solutions where possible. Continue reminding the team why we are here and focusing on our mission/outcomes rather than being hindered by any noise from other stakeholders that aren't our customer/focus.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Led the Zscaler CNAP POC, design, and enablement effort—establishing the IL5-approved zero-trust egress/ingress model for the entire platform. Later on took ownership of other CNAP components (NGFW, tf automation)
   1. took full ownership of the Zscaler Cloud Native Application Protection (CNAP) implementation for IL5—including the initial proof-of-concept, AWS GovCloud integration, TGW + GWLB service insertion, role/IAM scoping, app connector connection, spoke-account route automation requirements, and the creation of clear, repeatable documentation and KT material for engineering and security teams.
   2. Eliminated major blockers around IL5 egress control by defining least-privilege CNAP roles for transit + spoke accounts, ensuring compliance with SC-7, AC-4, and boundary-protection mandates
2. Secured GCP Partnership Accreditation (Service Partner + Government Sector Subcontractor), Unlocking New Revenue Paths, $6K Credits, and Marketing Opportunities
   1. Achieved formal GCP partnership recognition, enabling the company to deliver Google Cloud consulting, modernization, and platform engineering services across both commercial and federal programs.
   2. Completed all government-sector subcontractor onboarding steps (including GCP Professional certification) allowing us to participate in public-sector GCP opportunities—a key strategic expansion area.
   3. Secured $6,000 in GCP billing credits, giving our engineering teams the ability to prototype, train, and test workloads at zero cost, accelerating internal capability development.
   4. Partnered with Marketing leadership to establish co-marketing alignment with Google (opened doors for Marketing Funds requests, as well as potential funding for the summit which is WIP)
3. Drove Engineering Hiring Quality and Scalability by Serving as a Primary Interviewer and Training New Interviewers
   1. I have been one of the most consistent and reliable engineers participating in the technical interview pipeline, regularly conducting candidate evaluations and actively training additional engineers to become confident, calibrated interviewers. I am the only platform engineer who is still actively interviewing (both for external candidates and internal promotions) from years ago when we made our first pass at a technical assessment, because I believe it is one of the most important factors in reaching our growth goals and scalability for our BHAG.

**Comment**:
> Eric is one of the best teammates I've had, not just on this contract but in my entire time at the company. He is the very definition of a team player, consistently willing to do the "dirty work"—whatever the team needs to succeed—without a second thought. I am beyond grateful to have him on the team.




His technical skills are ridiculously strong, honed by the wide range of challenges he tackles for both our team and the company as a whole. He's a highly creative problem-solver who is always jumping into the next challenge. This technical excellence is matched by his collaborative spirit; he's super fun to pair with and brings a kind, light presence to the team that makes everyone around him better.




His positive attitude and willingness to do what it takes make him an invaluable asset. He is a core part of our success.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep being the ultimate team player.** Your willingness to do whatever it takes, including the dirty work, is a foundational part of our team's culture and success.
- **Keep applying your creative problem-solving skills.** Your unique approach to challenges is a massive asset, and your technical expertise is top-tier.
- **Keep being an incredible collaborator.** Your positive attitude makes you a ton of fun to work with and elevates the entire team dynamic.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start actively sharing your problem-solving frameworks with others.** You have a really creative and effective way of approaching problems. I would encourage you to start being more vocal about your thought process—whether in pairing sessions or team discussions—to help other members of the team learn from your approach.




#### **Stop Doing**
- Honestly, there is nothing I would recommend you stop doing. Your current approach to your work, your team, and your own growth is a model for others, and I wouldn't change a thing.

Your deep knowledge of GovTech and security makes you an invaluable resource, and I frequently send people your way because I know you’ll have the answer.
**Stop:**
- Stop keeping a low profile! You have the technical chops and the professional reputation to be a louder voice in the room, you have the credibility to lead from the front.
**Start:**
- I would like to see you start taking ownership of the "bigger picture." This means leading monthly updates and translating your technical engineering tasks into long-term roadmaps. You have the expertise—now is the time to start showing the wider group *how* you think by sharing your documentation and strategy publicly.

He stands out for his exceptional reliability. When Eric takes on a task—particularly the most complex and challenging assignments—I have absolute confidence that it will be handled effectively and seen through to completion. He is incredibly persistent, refusing to back down from a tough problem until he delivers a robust solution.




Eric is an excellent team member whose contributions are consistently high quality. His peers and I deeply value his steady, dependable presence, and his ability to successfully manage complicated issues ensures our major deliverables remain on track and meet the highest possible standards.

We also deeply appreciate your collaborative spirit—you're always ready to help teammates, provide insightful ideas, and apply your problem-solving skills to any challenge that comes your way.




**Start:** You often volunteer for tasks or to run meetings as needed and that's hugely appreciated but it's clear you have the ability to lead and own. Perhaps you could start owning more of the planning, delegation, unblocking others, and presentation planning. This would be a great way to formally channel all your strengths into a larger, high-impact area.
