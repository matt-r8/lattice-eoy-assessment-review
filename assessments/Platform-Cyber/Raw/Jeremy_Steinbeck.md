**Comment**:
> **1. Be Bold**




I consistently demonstrated the principle of "Be Bold" by acting as a proactive driving force for the cyber team, particularly in the face of initial ambiguity. Rather than waiting for a fully-formed, perfectly clear set of requirements, I made the calculated decision to lead the charge immediately. I took the initiative to convene the team and stakeholders, facilitating a rapid effort to define the essential next steps and scope the work. This proactive leadership was crucial in overcoming early inertia, ensuring that the team maintained a necessary forward momentum and began delivering value sooner. My action set the tone for decisive, outcome-oriented execution.




**2. Do The Right Thing**




My leadership was guided by a steadfast commitment to "Do The Right Thing," with a sharp focus on integrity and ethical conduct. A key demonstration of this was my response when our trust relationship with a critical client was compromised. I didn't engage in short-term damage control or defensive maneuvers. Instead, I prioritized transparency, accountability, and consistent execution to rebuild and solidify that trust. My actions were designed to unequivocally reinforce our dedication not only to the client's overarching mission but also to the high professional standards of Rise8, confirming that we value long-term, ethical partnership over immediate, short-term expediency.




**3. Do What Works**




I embodied the value "Do What Works" through the successful bootstrapping of a cyber practice while operating in the role of a Product Manager. My approach was rigorously focused on mission and business impact: I worked backward from the undeniable requirement to establish a robust security offering. This endeavor necessitated a highly agile, experimental approach. I rapidly iterated on hypotheses regarding the optimal internal structure, the necessary roles and capabilities within the team, and the most effective client engagement model. This pragmatic, results-driven process ensured that our efforts were focused on delivering demonstrable, high-impact *outcomes* for the client, not merely a checklist of theoretical *outputs*.




**4. Do What is Required**




The value "Do What is Required" was a daily commitment in my work on the FORGE program. I understood that achieving ultimate success and delivering significant impact for the customer depended on a tireless effort to complete all necessary, often difficult, activities. I dedicated myself and the team to meeting every challenge, no matter how demanding, recognizing that these "hard things"—the intense, detailed work—were the non-negotiable precursors to the desired strategic outcomes and mission-critical impact we promised to deliver.




**5. Always Be Kind**




I believe that "Always Be Kind" must coexist with high standards. I made it a deliberate practice to deliver critical and constructive feedback to teammates—a necessary component of continuous improvement—while maintaining a deeply supportive environment. I adhered to the principle of challenging directly (on performance and behavior) but caring personally (for the individual). My goal was to elevate the performance and capabilities of the entire team while simultaneously fostering a professional atmosphere that was both supportive and psychologically safe.




**6. Keep it Real**




I lived the value of "Keep it Real" by embracing radical transparency and full ownership. I ensured that both the team and I were always honest about results, being clear-eyed about risks, and candidly assessing opportunities, especially during periods when client trust was fragile. I consistently took full, unequivocal ownership of the team’s performance and results, fostering a culture where we faced operational and client challenges head-on without engaging in blame-shifting or creating excuses.




**7. Outcomes in Production**




My entire focus as a cyber lead was squarely on "Outcomes in Production." This meant moving beyond documentation and planning to the concrete delivery and sustained support of tangible security outcomes. These deliverables were instrumental in directly enabling the successful operation of the FORGE program and ensuring the functional, repeatable readiness and maturity of the new cyber practice itself.




**8. Grit**




The establishment of a new cyber practice from the ground up, coupled with the sustained, intense workload required to stabilize and advance the FORGE program, stands as a testament to my "Grit." I persevered through significant initial obstacles, including challenging internal structural uncertainties and complex client-relation issues. My commitment to the overarching mission provided the necessary determination to push through adversity and ensure the long-term viability of the effort.




**9. Growth Mindset**




I actively embody a "Growth Mindset" through a dedicated pursuit of continuous improvement. This is evident in my consistent decision to volunteer for internal initiatives aimed at enhancing and standardizing Rise8’s broader cybersecurity and Risk Management Framework (RMF) practices. I view every internal challenge or capability gap not as a permanent limitation, but as a critical opportunity to develop and expand my own professional expertise, as well as the collective capability of the company, through hard work and focused dedication.




**10. No Unnecessary Rules**




I am a strong proponent of our high-agency environment, which aligns perfectly with the value of "No Unnecessary Rules." My focus is on empowering the team to act with speed, autonomy, and effectiveness. I consciously resist the temptation to impose bureaucratic overhead or implement rules and processes that would stifle initiative, ensuring that the team remains agile and focused on delivering results for our client mission.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep Doing: I will keep sharing my knowledge and domain expertise to continue up-skilling teammates. I will also maintain my proactive approach to volunteering to better the internal cybersecurity and RMF practice, ensuring we continue to improve our offerings and delivery processes.
- Stop Doing: I will work to stop taking on all the ambiguous requirements personally. Instead, I will focus on delegating the initial exploratory work, empowering other team members to drive clarity and own the problem-solving process while maintaining coaching oversight.
- Start Doing: I plan to start formalizing the structures of the cyber practice that I've bootstrapped, creating repeatable processes and clear career pathways for team members. I also plan to start proactively mentoring one or two Rising A Players on the team to intentionally develop the next generation of leaders.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Accomplishment 1: Bootstrapped and established the FORGE Cyber Practice as a Product Manager.**
- **Impact:** This directly supports Rise8's mission to assemble high-performing teams by creating a necessary and sustainable capability. It allows Rise8 to deliver on brand promises by offering comprehensive security services and enables growth into new, security-focused client work. I worked closely with the more senior PM to help set up the cyber team to work more effectively like a product team. This has positively impacted the value streams that outcomes that the Rise8 FORGE cyber team has achieved. 
**Accomplishment 2: Drove critical action and achieved success on the FORGE program.**
- **Impact:** Despite unclear initial requirements, I ensured the cyber team is on track to meet critical milestones, which will directly lead to mission success for the client. This reinforces Rise8's reputation for delivering outcomes and secures our standing with a key customer. Before I joined the team there was no clear path to success and the team was floundering. I help steer the team in the right direction. 
**Accomplishment 3: Restored and created trust with the client when it was in jeopardy.**
**Impact:** This stabilized a critical client relationship, securing future work and embodying the value of Do The Right Thing. Strong, trusting customer relationships are foundational to Rise8's ability to fulfill its promise. By showing up every day and representing Rise8 as the SME in Cloud, RMF and Security Engineering we have gained the trust of the client.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Jeremy joined the program while it was already underway and immediately demonstrated grit by immersing himself and hitting the ground running. He brings a wealth of wisdom regarding cybersecurity, RMF, and DoD platform delivery that has been invaluable to our success.
He has gone above and beyond to do what is required, stepping into dual roles as both Team Anchor and PM. In this capacity, he has excelled at prioritizing work, documenting strategy, and ensuring radical transparency in who is doing what. Perhaps most impressively, Jeremy has been a stabilizing force during team shifts. He presents a consistent, calm face to external stakeholders, building a high degree of trust with a challenging audience—proof that he knows how to manage relationships to achieve outcomes. He also embodies a growth mindset, taking feedback in stride and taking immediate action to improve.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep being that deep well of knowledge. Your expertise is massive, but the grace with which you share it is what makes you a true Riser. I look to you as an example of how to maintain reason and focus amidst chaos.
- Keep maintaining that calm, consistent voice. You have done an incredible job aligning multiple parties and gaining trust under pressure. Your demeanor is a perfect example of temperance and is vital for our stakeholder management.
- Keep feedback loops tight, but Start escalating to leadership more quickly when that feedback doesn't produce change. We value radical truth, and if a blocker persists, we need to know so we can help resolve it.
- Keep up-skilling those on your team to reduce the number of plates you are spinning. To maintain a sustainable dream team, you need to be able to hand off responsibilities without worry. We need to protect you from burnout so you can take the time off you deserve.

**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Jeremy is currently operating at a high capacity, effectively navigating a project with high complexity (resistant stakeholders, large cyber scope). He stands out for his willingness to challenge the status quo to drive results, while possessing the emotional intelligence to recover and strengthen relationships during difficult periods.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start** acting as a "force multiplier" by delegating authority. Empower your senior engineers to own entire domains rather than just distributing tasks. This trust builds their confidence and frees you to focus on strategic influence rather than day-to-day execution.
- **Start** enforcing an "action over semantics" boundary when clients get bogged down in terminology. Stakeholders often lose sight of the actual delivery goals by obsessing over definitions. When this happens, pivot the conversation back to tangible execution to ensure the focus remains on unblocking the mission rather than debating words.
- **Consider** shifting from being the central "source of truth" to the architect of shared knowledge. While your deep expertise is a huge asset, holding architecture and compliance details centrally can create a bottleneck. Codifying these answers will allow the team to operate independently and help protect you from burnout.
- **Continue** challenging the status quo to drive delivery. Your willingness to push back on government stakeholders to ensure we are shipping value, even when it creates friction, is a vital quality. You balance this necessary friction with the emotional intelligence to maintain relationships, which is rare.
- **Continue** upskilling the team to build a high-performance culture. You have successfully fostered a team that is laser-focused on high-quality delivery. Continuing to mentor and grow the technical capabilities of those around you is essential for the team's long-term success.
