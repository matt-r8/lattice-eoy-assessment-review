**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe my teammates would enthusiastically rehire me due to the measurable impact I have driven and my commitment to team and personal growth. I consistently contributed to and delivered on our key mission metrics, including key work on a transformative reduction in deployment time from weeks to three working days, standardized CI/CD with automated quality gates across all the tenant teams of LHDI, and contributed to corrective initiatives to mitigate systemic risks. Furthermore, I demonstrated a strong growth mindset by achieving the CKA certification, consistently soliciting feedback from my teammates, and enabling tenants with standardized best practices. This work, including designing golden paths and being proactive in enablement help, has contributed to increased team efficiency and fostering a culture of shared ownership. My proactive engagement and reliable execution make me a highly valuable contributor.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I will keep contributing and driving measurable outcomes. I will keep seeking regular feedback from my peers and taking swift action to address growth areas. I will keep seeking professional growth and learning opportunities. I will start proactively seeking dedicated and formal leadership opportunities within my contract to expand my engagement with stakeholders and also within my immediate team. I will stop taking constructive feedback personally.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Delivered team-level outcomes by significantly improving the foundational tooling and processes that resulted in transformative reduction in deployment time from several weeks to 3 working days. This directly solved a major point of friction and enables tenants to deploy successfully in a quicker timeframe. By reducing this deployment barrier through the use of Backstage templates, we ensure tenant applications can be deployed reliably and quickly, accelerating the realization of cost savings and mission goals. 
2. Actively participated in and drove the identification of systemic risks, risks that arise from a lack of golden path, which resulted in major corrective initiatives. This work directly led to a CI/CD pipeline that introduced automated quality across all of the tenant repositories on LHDI, which aids in reinforcing best practices of the platform. This will help in mitigating long-term risks associated with misconfigurations and non-HA setups, ensuring service reliability and compliance.
3. Fostered a Growth Mindset by introducing tools and practices--such as designing Golden Path policies as code and being proactive in enablement help--and personally achieving the CKA certification. These high-leverage actions standardize best-practices, reduce developer friction, and increase the overall velocity and maturity of the tenant teams using the LHDI platform. This scales impact beyond our immediate team.

**Comment**:
> Jodie had a great year on the enablement team. She’s always learning, growing, and honing her skills. She’s a pleasure to work with and has gained a lot of confidence throughout the year. I noticed this more and more as time went on, and by the end of the contract she was taking full ownership of her work. She even achieved her long-term goal of earning her CKA. She proactively seeks feedback and consistently acts on it. I appreciate her honesty, her positive attitude, and the role she plays on the team. She’s also a great presenter.

**Comment**:
> Jodie is driven by exceptional commitment and **Grit**. She is always striving to learn and grow, rapidly demonstrating her mastery of new skills and technologies, as evidenced by her achievement of the CKA certification. This continuous improvement allows her to embody the spirit to **Be Bold** and contribute at a high level.




As a member of the Dev Enablement team, she has demonstrated a strong commitment to Do What is Required to develop and deliver a world-class onboarding experience. A key differentiator is her resilience: she has navigated uncertainty and demanding situations not by complaining, but by being bold and taking decisive action to ensure the program's success.
Her dedication translates directly into results; she was invaluable and effective when working with others to solve complex issues on the ATTV project, underscoring her commitment to outcomes.




Jodie's professionalism is consistently guided by her unwavering commitment to **Do the Right Thing**. Her exceptional kindness is evident in her eagerness to help and willingness to jump in to troubleshoot in any situation.
She helps the team **Keep it Real** by addressing technical issues directly and constructively. This dedication to her peers is always paired with a consistently generous, warm, and approachable attitude. She is a shining example of **Always be Kind**, which makes her a highly valued and effective collaborator.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I strongly encourage Jodie to continue fostering her growth mindset and building on her excellent track record of mastering new technologies, as evidenced by her CKA achievement. This pursuit of advanced technical mastery will further accelerate the team's ability to deliver timely, impactful production outcomes.




I recommend that Jodie step up and lead a project from inception to completion this year. She clearly possesses the technical acumen and necessary skills to excel in a leadership capacity. Providing her with formal project ownership will allow her to demonstrate her leadership potential, delegate tasks effectively, and influence the program's broader technical direction.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I know Jodie has put in a ton of work to learn platform engineering, even getting her CKA, which is awesome. The next growth area is to start to take more of an active role on the team and helping it move its goals forward. That will mean taking opinionated positions on team goals, project direction, and implementation decisions. Its one thing to pick up backlog stories and have someone else guide what to do - I'd like to see her feel and take a sense of ownership on the work and define its implementation strategy, then do the work to see it through. That sense of ownership will also, I think, help her become more autonomous and take an active role in team interactions, both internally and with other teams that we would collaborate with.

### Question 12
