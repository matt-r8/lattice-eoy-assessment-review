### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Delivering Value & Outcomes**




- **Runtime Vulnerability Visibility:** successfully deployed a daily production image scanner (DARS), which achieved a zero-to-one shift in security posture by providing assessors with **100% visibility** into runtime vulnerabilities. This directly enables assessors to interface with tenants to establish remediation plans within days of discovery.
   - **Measurable Impact:** The count of undetected critical vulnerabilities in production was reduced from **84 to zero**.
- **Vulnerability Management 2.0 Released:** completed a significant refactor to enable the CRM to store runtime vulnerability data with a full event history, including **"First Found" and "Days Open"** per vulnerability.
   - **Mission Impact:** This crucial work is the foundation for measuring the new **"Total Critical Risk Exposure Days"** and allows assessors to track remediation SLAs.
- **CodeQL Transition & Snyk Deprecation:** The V7 pipeline, featuring the **full transition to CodeQL for SAST** and deprecation of Snyk Code Scanning, was successfully released and monitored.
   - **Mission Impact:** This avoided a new procurement cost for the VA and advanced static analysis capabilities.

**Stop**: Can't think of any detrimental behaviors for now




**Keep**: Your eye for detail and making sure we encompass not only the story A/C but also software design and security hygiene. Keep on being laser-focused on outcomes for the team and for the customer

You can 100%. count on him to be there for the team and the work, he's the cybersecurity and RMF SME for our team, he jumps in on everything from leading user interviews to diagraming CI/CD pipelines, he's aware of the goals of the project and lets that guide his actions. He's just an awesome teammate, and member of the ACE team.

**Comment**:
> Even though we have only been working together for two months in this research and discovery phase, I would absolutely rehire Jeremy. Finding a security engineer who is also a genuine collaborator during the messy synthesis process is rare, but Jeremy fits that description perfectly. He doesn't just point out problems; he actively helps the team visualize the boundaries of the system and our constraints through the diagrams and artifacts he produces.




I’ve been particularly impressed by his ability to keep a cool head when stakeholder dynamics get tense. He has a knack for spotting dysfunctional behaviors that could damage our project and isn't afraid to call them out to me privately, which shows high integrity. He is already helping us connect with the right influencers to move our cATO report forward. Jeremy is showing all the early signs of an A Player who cares about the mission outcome, not just the security compliance checklist.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
- **Defining the "Security Discovery":** Start expressing your opinion on how we should run discovery to satisfy the RMF process. Don't wait for a PM to define this for you; I’d love to see you lead the negotiation on when we shift between traditional discovery and compliance frameworks.
- **Leading Diagnostics:** Start facilitating the diagnostic activities yourself. To really step into that Staff-level role, I want you to not just execute the work, but guide the team through what good looks like regarding our technical security risks.
- **Strategic Mapping:** Start articulating why specific stakeholders are useful to us and how we should earn their trust. Help the team understand the strategy behind the relationships so we can be more intentional about our influence.




**Stop**
- **Holding Back:** Stop letting other people talk for you in meetings, even when we are in listening mode. You have a unique perspective on security discovery that we need to hear directly to ensure we are being bold enough in our approach.
- **Assuming We "Get It":** Stop assuming the rest of the team is fluent in security practices or RMF. I need you to pause and teach us the technical considerations so we don't miss risks or misinterpret the strategy. 
- **Letting Us Spin:** Stop allowing the team to spend too much time on lines of inquiry that you know in your gut aren't valuable. If you see us going down a rabbit hole that won't ultimately help the cATO report, push back immediately so we don't waste time.




**Keep**
- **Visualizing the "Box":** Please keep producing those diagrams and visual artifacts. In this complex environment, your ability to visualize our constraints helps the whole team understand the playing field quickly and do what works.
- **Steady Composure:** Keep maintaining your cool demeanor during difficult stakeholder meetings. It anchors the team, and your ability to identify which external behaviors and influences are actually damaging to the project is a huge asset to me.
- **Connecting the Dots:** Keep focusing on what's next and ensuring we are connected to the right people. Your instinct to find the individuals who actually hold influence rather than just following the org chart is exactly what we need to execute our strategy. Really take more ownership of this. It will be useful later if we get a renewal.

**Comment**:
> I've always really enjoyed working with Jeremy; he has a great combination of soft skills and technical skills and has a really valuable background in the type of work we need to be excellent at here at Rise8. He always impresses me with the way he looks outside of just his own work and asks questions about the rest of the team, taking insights from how we prioritize the backlog to ensure developers are supported and fulfilled while also pushing outcomes. He's one of the few developers who asks, "I don't see the outcome here," or "I don't know what this is trying to deliver," which are awesome questions to get from an anchor.




We did have to work through defining roles and scopes for him as an anchor at the beginning, and that probably lasted a little longer than it needed to, mostly because I had to learn what it meant to have an anchor on this team. But I already miss Jeremy on our team, and I would enthusiastically rehire him for sure. I also love seeing that he's taken it seriously to stay in touch with us and give us feedback on what they're learning over at Ace.
Jeremy is extremely **'Bold,'** bringing his whole self to work and having the courage to post in public channels about his life and work. He is one of the better devs I've seen at **'Doing What Works'** by working backward from mission impact. For **'Always Be Kind,'** even though he is sarcastic, he has always got the best interest at heart and doesn't have a mean bone in his body. He has a really strong **'Growth Mindset,'** going to conferences and bringing back tools and solutions to the team. He is very comfortable in a **'High Agency'** environment (**'No Unnecessary Rules'**), though he does appreciate some guardrails to be most effective.




The areas where he is a **'Team Leader' (Top 5%)** rather than 'Best in Grade' are around execution details. For **'Do What is Required,'** menial tasks (like prioritizing tech debt) tended to slip through the cracks. For **'Outcomes in Production,'** he asks great questions to shape them, but he isn't as proactive in pushing them through or identifying them in our tech stack. I would **'Strongly Agree'** to enthusiastically rehire him.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For your growth, the main thing to **start** doing is taking ownership of the parts of roles and responsibilities that you decide are yours. A good example is tech debt—some of those items should have turned into support outcomes or been pushed harder. **Start** getting curious about how the team is performing (velocity, etc.) and bring insights from your interrupt pair back up to the team to prioritize healthy development practices, not just features. **Continue** to bring your whole self to work and share your learnings (like you do from Ace)—it's a huge value add.**Continue** being the person who notices when someone is stuck in a silo during retro; that's a superpower. Finally, **continue** asking those "I don't see the outcome here" questions; they force the team to be better.
