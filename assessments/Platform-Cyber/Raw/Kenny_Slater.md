**Comment**:
> Since joining Rise8 in July, I have quickly taken ownership of the Bifrost project and established myself as a key driver of its success. I developed the ATO strategy that positions Rise8 for long-term success. I have not taken the easy route, I do what is required.
I proactively traveled to San Antonio to meet with the Warp Core ISSMs and our Palantir partners within my first ~60 days at the company, strengthening relationships and advancing our mission's objectives. I have also made multiple trips to Los Angeles to meet directly with the customer, often outside of requirement, to demonstrate our commitment to the mission and build trust with stakeholders.




I have completed all required ATO documentation for our platform (with the help of an amazing team). I built the Bifrost front door website as a tool to help the whole team. Additionally, I partake in company RMF practice working groups outside of my Bifrost requirements as a way to standardize Rise8 RMF practices.




I humbly believe I consistently demonstrate initiative, drive, and passion for not only my success within my role, but ensuring the Rise8 image is one that delivers impact.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep doing: I plan to keep driving the Bifrost mission like my life depends on it. I plan to keep facilitating the hard discussions with key role players, even if it means traveling often. I believe we are working in an environment where it is easier for the customer to say "no." I will not accept that "no" and fight through the compliance bureaucracy.




Start: I will start efforts that benefit the company as a whole. Whether that means giving Lightning Talks, organizing company RMF practice ventures, assisting in off-sites, or any company beneficial initiative that pops up.  




Stop: I have internally debated the risk/reward of communicating the challenges of the ATO process with the Bifrost team. I say that because as an InfoSec analyst I know these challenges are all part of the process and we will eventually receive approval. However as engineers, I do not want them to be concerned and possibly affect their work. I believe communication is extremely important, but I have started considering that "less is more" as to let us RMF professionals handle the approval process and let the engineers build the exceptional pipeline that they're building.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Building trust with the customer: I believe by taking the initiative to travel multiple times to meet with our customer face to face early in the contract is a key driver of why Bifrost WILL be successful. I also believe that I have built relationships with a sister project called Project 6 which delivers strategic advantage. Project 6 has a higher priority than Bifrost and by building that relationship, I have artificially raised our priority piggybacking off their precedence. I always ensure that all customer facing engagements represent Rise8 to the highest standards.




Buy in on the Bifrost ATO strategy: This is a work in progress, however I have 1. Developed the ATO strategy and 2. Briefed our ATO strategy to our customer over 5 separate times, each time with key stakeholders and changing with their feedback and guidance for approval. This has been a challenging task as getting approval for a CI/CD platform that delivers Government and 3rd party applications using a 3rd party contracted tool (Palantir Mission Manager) to multiple classifications is not an easy task. I believe the odds are stacked against us for a plethora of reasons (customer not wanting to give us our own ATO, customer not wanting to approve GitLab, customer not wanting to approve DevSecOps within their boundary, etc.) but I truly believe we are getting closer and closer to approval and I will not stop until we get everything we need and want. 




Positioning myself as a key player within the Bifrost and RMF team: I humbly believe that within my short time here, I have worked hard to gain the trust (from the team) in making big decisions that affect the Bifrost mission. I have earned the respect of my peers and leadership to brief the customer and engage in company RMF discussions on a consistent basis. I have written the majority of Bifrost policy and security related documentation. I feel comfortable engaging with leadership and capturing Bifrost's interests.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> He is a key driver for the team, consistently advocating for us to do the hard work needed to get things across the finish line. Just as importantly, his positive attitude and friendly demeanor make him an excellent collaborator and a pleasure to work with. He has a rare combination of skills that builds confidence: his resume shows he *can* do the job, while his words and actions provide *certainty* that he's doing it right.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start:
- Proactively identifying and championing the automation of your manual tasks. Your deep experience with ATO packages and change requests is a huge asset. Your next level of impact will be to *start* treating those manual tasks as automation opportunities for our SWEs, not just as work you have to do yourself.
Stop:
- Stop (or at least, be the first to challenge) the default acceptance of these manual processes. It's tempting to just get them done, but I'd like you to stop and ask, "How can the engineers contribute to this so we *never* have to do it manually again?"
Keep:
- Being the person who advocates for getting things across the finish line. That results-oriented drive is critical.
- Providing that "certainty" in your work. Your high-quality, reliable output is what allows the team to move fast.
- Keep that positive attitude and friendly demeanor. It makes the team better and is a huge part of what makes you so effective.

> Kenny is the indispensable subject matter expert responsible for navigating the project's most significant challenge: achieving the Authority to Operate (ATO). His contributions span high-stakes political strategy, deep technical compliance execution, and critical efforts to maintain team clarity and process efficiency. He is the anchor for all Risk Management Framework (RMF) and security accreditation efforts. Kenny has repeatedly taken the initiative to engage high-level stakeholders and define the project’s complex path through bureaucracy, viewing the challenge as "high risk, high reward".

**Comment**:
> You have been insanely helpful, I've never had the opportunity to work with someone so close to the ATO effort before. But I see how helpful it is to have someone dedicated to that effort, from actual paperwork to aligning epics to cover for cyber requirements, your work helps breakdown engineering into more digestible pieces.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> You have definitely been very active in engineering discussions despite it not being your trade. But having you in those discussions, offering opinions from a compliance and cyber security point of view has been tremendously helpful. Having you learn about the engineering efforts has vastly improved how our team tackles architecture diagrams all the way down to more technical efforts like what kinds scans can we run. 
Going forward it might also be helpful to hop in a breakout room with a pair whose story might be more cyber/compliance focused just to help them think and align on a solution. Having your perspective is like adding another dimension of smarts to our team. 
Also, I love when you breakdown the ATO discussions to layman's terms. It helps someone like me understand the details of what is actually going on. In the beginning you spoke a little to broadly just saying that you had the paths covered, but over time you actually broke down what documents you had prepared/worked on which painted a better picture onto what was happening from your side.

His persistence, deep understanding of cybersecurity principles, and solution-oriented mindset continue to set a high standard for excellence. It’s clear from his leadership, technical insight, and strategic thinking that he has the capability to excel in a higher-level cyber role, and I believe he would thrive in positions with expanded responsibility and decision-making authority.

**Comment**:
> The Bifrost team has been very lucky to have Kenny leading the RMF side of the project, especially with his extensive experience with ATO packages. Kenny is always willing to do what is required and has advocated doing the right thing since the very beginning of the project. While we continue to iron out the ATO path with our government stakeholders, he keeps the team encouraged with our progress and puts everyone at ease. Given that our path continues to be murky, he's always working to figure out different avenues for our path forward. He's willing to go out of his way to have conversations with people, helping the team build relationships with folks like Jason Pinto and the Warp Core ISSMs, who were initially thought to possibly be detractors. These conversations have been invaluable as we ended up with more advocates on what are deemed higher priority projects to the program office, opening up more options for us to explore for accreditation. Kenny is an essential member of the Bifrost team.

> - **Keep** building on technical knowledge of the platform - the more you know, the more you can inform the team on any process/feature that needs to be implemented before we're in too deep on a specific feature.
- **Keep** sharing/educating the rest of the team on RMF - the more we know, the more we can implement security and compliance earlier. Graham's departure especially opens up the need for this and people are receptive to learning more about RMF. 
- **Start** incorporating automation to parts of the RMF process - this should ease some of the burden on yourself/Tiyyiba as we continue to expand our customer base and you'll be able to focus on less manual tasks.
