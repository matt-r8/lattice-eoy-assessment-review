**Comment**:
> As the engineering lead on FORGE, I have strived to embody the "Player-Coach" mentality required of a leader. My role requires a delicate balance: operating at the portfolio level to set high-level vision and strategy, while simultaneously diving into the technical trenches with delivery teams to drive architectural decisions.
I have leveraged my hybrid background in platform engineering, IT, and cybersecurity to bridge the gap between the various delivery teams, ensuring we Do What is Required to satisfy and surpass RMF and technical expectations. I pride myself on my Growth Mindset—specifically my ability to rapidly ingest concerns or feedback and immediately create actions to resolve them.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep refining the balance between high-level Portfolio work and deep-dive interactions with delivery teams.
- Keep up-skilling other engineers. A Dream Team is built on mentorship. I want to ensure that as I grow, I am pulling others up with me to create a sustainable engineering culture.
- Start/keep expanding my scope beyond FORGE. I want to take the lessons learned and the culture built here and apply them to increase my value across Rise8, assisting with other programs and business development efforts to help the company scale while maintaining the culture that brought me in.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Strategic Alignment & Technical Planning - I played a key role in creating a consistent project plan across delivery teams, including the creation of the initial FORGE portfolio roadmap. I iterated closely with the Delivery Lead to generate a plan that all teams could get behind, developing architecture and technical strategy documents for all epics to ensure technical details were fully aligned with the project plan.
2. RMF - I reviewed and helped write implementation narratives for all 20 RMF SOPs and generated the body of evidence required for proving we do what we say we do. I also translated these requirements into a technical backlog to ensuring we meet and exceed security controls.
3. Foundational Facilitation & Artifact Creation - I took on a large portion of the initial documentation and facilitation required to start the program on the right foot. This included leading D&F activities, generating DDD artifacts, creating architecture diagrams, and defining RACI charts.

**Comment**:
> Steven is a clear leader in the field of platform development. He is the person that people on his portfolio team, the delivery teams and the client, come to for expertise and guidance on the best way forward. He is a subject matter expert in this domain who i feel we can all learn from. He is awesome to work with! My only suggestion for improvement would have been freeing up some of his time responding to the multiple requests and questions he fielded by thinking about some mechanisms of delegation/enablement that would help with him being spread thinly. As a portfolio colleague, I would have benefitted from spending more time with him crafting strategy together.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: thinking about how to spread your knowledge around the team in a sustainable way if possible. Thinking about ways to push back on/lead the client to the outcome first way of thinking, especially with examples from your deep experience. Provide fast and direct feedback when needed to delivery teams to keep them on the right track especially if you can see them moving in a direction that seems not optimal or too slow.
Stop: You can be direct and fast with you feedback if we worked together in future and I would value it. Don't feel you need to hold off on that for your team or delivery teams.
Keep: Being an excellent well of information that your colleagues and clients trust. The calm and positive attitude in the face of difficult situations. Spreading your knowledge and educating the client and internal teams on the most effective approach to the problems at hand.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### Keep Doing




**1. Driving Critical Project Outcomes & Risk Management:** Please **keep** your incredible ability to identify and solve core project risks. Your initiative to petition for and secure the subject matter expert for the legacy system was a game-changing move. I believe that one action significantly de-risked the entire project and turned around a critical workstream. It was a perfect example of senior-level problem-solving, and it did not go unnoticed.
**2. Building Team Morale & Trust:** You are an absolute pleasure to work with. Please **keep** bringing your positive, professional, and humorous energy to the team. You are quick with a joke when it's needed and create an environment of high trust and rapport. That "buddy" atmosphere you foster makes people (myself included) feel comfortable, respected, and motivated to put in the extra effort to make the team successful.




### Start Doing




**1. Connecting Delivery to Broader Company Strategy:** For your next stage of growth, I would recommend you **start** finding opportunities to connect your team's execution even more deeply to the broader Rise 8 company mission. You have the knowledge and experience to be a major strategic voice. I believe you could amplify your impact even further by more explicitly aligning your team's work with the company's "Outcome-Based Delivery" model.
A tactical way to do this might be to shadow "Prod Patrol" or a similar group. Seeing firsthand how those strategic outcomes are shaped, assessed, and approved could provide powerful insights for you to drive strategy from your leadership position.




### Stop Doing




**1. Defaulting to "I'll Do It Myself" on Non-Critical Tasks:** This is a "stop" in the sense of a transition. I would recommend you **stop** taking on certain tasks yourself and, instead, more aggressively delegate or pair on them, even if it feels slower at first.
A specific example was the Risk Management Framework documentation. While I know at the time you were likely the most qualified person to do it, your time is even more valuable when focused on high-level leadership and engineering strategy.
Moving forward, I'd encourage you to pass those kinds of tasks to the appropriate team or pair with a more junior member to get them up to speed. This would be a huge win: it would free up your time for the high-impact work only you can do, and it would simultaneously build capability and knowledge elsewhere in the organization.

**Comment**:
> **Overview: Why I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser** Bair is a cornerstone of the FORGE project and one of the most capable engineers I have ever worked with. He possesses the rare ability to seamlessly move between high-level technical strategy and deep-dive tactical execution, often rolling up his sleeves to unblock critical tasks the same day he defines the architecture. He consistently shows up with high integrity, doing what is right for the mission. Retaining Bair is a no-brainer; his skillset is critical to our success, and I would be resistant to losing him on the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start** prioritizing mentorship to multiply your impact across the portfolio. You are operating effectively at the portfolio level, but because of your high skill level, you often end up solving the hardest problems yourself. Your primary goal now is to invest in other engineers coaching them to solve problems the way you do. This ensures the portfolio's success is sustainable and not dependent solely on your individual bandwidth.
- **Start** providing clear, direct feedback as a tool for team growth. Your natural integrity and kindness are huge strengths, but sometimes they can unintentionally soften the message when expectations aren't being met. Remember that clarity is kindness. To help your team reach their full potential, challenge yourself to give feedback that is direct and unambiguous, so they know exactly where they stand and how to improve.
- **Consider** the long-term sustainability of jumping in to save the day. You are often the one unblocking the team, which everyone appreciates. However, if the portfolio relies on you personally to fix critical tasks, it creates a dependency. Consider using those "unblocking" moments as teaching opportunities instead, ensuring you are delivering team resilience.
- **Keep** bridging the gap between high-level strategy and tactical execution. This vertical capability, the ability to define the vision and then validate it in the code, is what gives you such high credibility. It is the foundation of your influence; never lose that connection to the ground truth.
- **Keep** modeling a mission-first integrity. Your willingness to do what is right for the mission, regardless of the difficulty, inspires trust. This is the intangible quality that makes everyone view you not just as a leader, but as a true partner in their success.

> Bair is the GOAT and is the definition of an A+ Player. They consistently deliver transformative results that go beyond their specific assignment and often their swim lane. I have relied on him not just to execute, but to set strategic direction for our security posture and platform architecture. He has displayed immense Grit by persevering through difficult challenges.

**Comment**:
> For the next year, I recommend you start aggressively scaling your influence and impact across the FORGE Team and beyond.




1. Start Delegating: You must delegate more technical execution work to team members. This directly protects you from burnout and ensures you have the capacity required to fulfill the Best in Grade responsibility of setting strategic direction. 




2. Start Enabling A-Players: Focus on driving the performance and growth of your teammates. Treat complex problems as coaching opportunities to help them develop a Growth Mindset and elevate their output to consistently produce A Player work. 




3. Start Pressing the Envelope: Use the time gained from delegation to Be Bold by identifying and championing capabilities that lead to transformative results to our clients.

> I have loved just about every second of working with Bair; he is an incredible human and coworker. His mind is exceptionally sharp, particularly when it comes to understanding personalities and relating to people. This gives him a profound sense of empathy, and I have always felt truly heard and listened to by him, as has the rest of the team.
He has a brilliant mindset for strategy, an open mind to new ideas, and carries the immense weight of this program with remarkable grace and stride. Even though he isn't hands-on-keyboard often, he has not lost his technical sharpness. He manages our stakeholders masterfully, creating a sense of safety and trust that is essential for the program's success. He is a phenomenal leader.

### Question 12
