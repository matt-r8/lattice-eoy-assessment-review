**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I believe I excel in the areas that Rise Eight values most, and I really try to live out our beliefs in the way I show up every day. I step into unclear or challenging situations, take ownership, and try to be bold in pushing the mission forward even when it feels uncomfortable. Doing the right thing for the customer and for the team is something I take seriously, and I try to make decisions that reflect integrity and long term trust. I focus on what actually works by starting from the impact we want, experimenting quickly, and adjusting when needed. I am not afraid to put in the hard work that turns ideas into real outcomes in production.




I also care about how I make people feel. I try to be kind and direct at the same time, giving honest feedback without losing the human side of it. I keep things real about risks, progress, and where I need help, and I take full ownership of my mistakes. When things get tough, I stay calm, dig in, and keep moving with grit and a growth mindset because I genuinely care about the mission and the team. I am comfortable with high agency and do not look for extra rules unless they truly help us succeed. Overall, I believe the team would rehire me because I am reliable, I deliver, and I show up in a way that reflects the values we talk about and try to embody at Rise Eight.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
- Start taking all the stuff we’ve figured out on Nebula and turning it into simple, repeatable patterns so other teams can move faster without needing me in every conversation.
- Start putting more time into helping folks level up in AWS and automating a lot of the account-level work, because we’re growing quick and it’s getting impossible to do everything manually.




### **Stop**
- Stop trying to hold all the AWS tasks on my shoulders and instead build the scripts, templates, and guardrails that let other people jump in without worrying.
- Stop letting the pace of work keep me from writing things down in the moment so everyone isn’t constantly rediscovering the same stuff.




### **Keep Doing**
- Keep sharing Nebula lessons with the rest of Rise8 so we’re all scaling in the same direction and not reinventing things.
- Keep taking on the hard, weird problems, but turn them into clearer paths and better automation so the next person touches it once and it just works.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. **Leading Cross-Program Cloud Architecture for Space Force Teams**
This year I was the only Rise8 engineer fully embedded with the Nebula customer team, which put me right at the center of how Space Force is trying to modernize and deliver. That let me take everything we learned on Nebula and turn it into clear guidance and repeatable patterns that other Rise8 and Space Force teams could actually use. A big part of that was helping Gateway understand what a real path to production looks like on Nebula and making sure they had a foundation that would actually work at scale.




I also played a key role in shaping what FORGE’s infrastructure looks like today. A lot of the early architectural decisions and secure AWS patterns came directly from the lessons we proved out on Nebula. By sharing that knowledge and helping FORGE get set up the right way, we now have multiple Space Force programs aligned on a modern, secure, and consistent approach to building and shipping software.




**2. Leading All Internal Rise8 AWS Management During Rapid Growth**




This year I became the sole AWS technical lead for AWS related work that entered our Rise8 ecosystem. All account onboarding, technical setup, architecture patterns, and long term AWS strategy started and ended with me. We brought in roughly twenty to twenty five new accounts in six months, and I personally ensured each one had a secure and scalable landing zone, proper guardrails, and the right foundation to succeed. I owned the entire pipeline, which allowed the partnership side of the business to grow quickly without stalling on the technical work.




Sean was originally hired as director of tools and was a huge help, but after his departure the responsibility for our AWS infrastructure and onboarding tool set fell entirely back to me. Despite that, nothing slowed down. I kept every system running, continued onboarding new accounts, and maintained the automation and patterns that the business depends on. It has been a heavy lift, but it allowed Rise8 to keep expanding partnerships and delivering value without missing a beat.




3. **Building Automation and Standing Up a Complete IL2 Environment for Nebula**




Another major accomplishment this year was standing up a full IL2 environment for Nebula completely from scratch and turning it into an automated, secure, and repeatable system. I built the core networking, SSM and DHMC setup, logging pipelines, cross account access patterns, flow logs, landing zones, and all of the guardrails we rely on. The focus was on automation first so Nebula would have a foundation that is reliable, scalable, and easy to reproduce as the mission grows.




This work will open the door for more companies to onboard into the Space Force ecosystem with fewer barriers and a much smoother path to production. By having a modern IL2 environment ready to go, Nebula can support more launches, onboard partners faster, and reduce the friction that usually slows down adoption. All of this directly strengthens Rise8’s mission of accelerating secure delivery and giving teams a clear and simple path to prod.

> I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser because he’s been a huge help to me and to the company. He manages our AWS environment with a level of calm and confidence that makes everything feel easier. Even though he’s not on my team, he never hesitates to jump in, answer questions, or walk me through things I don’t have experience with. He’s patient, easy to work with, and always willing to explain the “why,” not just the “how.” He makes complicated stuff feel manageable, and I really value how dependable and supportive he is.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
Start pushing for a dedicated person on the IT/Ops side so you don’t have to be the bottleneck for every AWS-related task. You shouldn’t have to carry all of that alone, and having the right support will free you up to focus on the deeper engineering work you’re great at.
**Stop:**
Stop downplaying how much you do behind the scenes. You take on a lot, and the impact is real don’t sell yourself short.
**Keep:**
Keep being the steady, patient, and incredibly helpful person you’ve been. The way you jump in, walk people through problems, and make complex work understandable has been a huge help. Your reliability and willingness to support others makes a big difference company-wide.
