**Comment**:
> As a team member I am consistent and reliable. I go out of my way to make the job easier for the next engineer when working on something typically through automation and documentation. I am naturally a curious person and enjoy pairing with others especially when troubleshooting something we have not encountered before. I am polite and courteous to other team members and I value other people's ideas, views, and opinions.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I plan to start reading more about platform engineering so I can stay up to date with the newest information and trends.




I plan to keep speaking up and contributing my input in team discussions.




I plan to stop doubting myself as much. I feel like it hinders my ability to want to speak up in team discussions.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I designed and automated the process for creating dedicated clusters for tenants in designated VPCs. This step was critical for not only creating the environments tenants will use but also enabling the ability for the platform team to scale the platform for more users.




I helped design and implement ArgoCD as well as the repository structure we plan to use so that we can manage services across clusters using ArgoCD. This is a critical step in creating the platform because ArgoCD will be one of the primary ways users will interface with the platform to manage their applications. I was meticulous in designing this particular configuration so that Applications in the ArgoCD UI were organized in an intuitive way, making it significantly easier for all users to manage many services across many clusters.




Worked closely with the FORGE Enablement team to help them setup their mock applications in their dedicated environments using ArgoCD and other platform services. Helping the Enablement team setup more quickly not only allowed them to get a head start on their own team's work, but it was helpful for the platform team to validate users would be able to use the platform to deploy applications and that they would have an easy time doing so.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Nick has acted as an anchor on LH and a force multiplier for the FORGE platform team. He embodies the Rise8 mentality by not just delivering individual contributions, but by providing guidance, pairing, and story writing to ensure the junior developers around him succeed. Since joining FORGE, Nick demonstrated incredible grit and a growth mindset by quickly getting up to speed on a new tech stack with little assistance. He immediately translated this into outcomes, delivering critical work on Istio research, GitLab build-outs, Red Hat IdM, configuring GitOps for the air-gapped platform, and more. He consistently demonstrates a bias for action that drives the program forward.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep ensuring the platform’s success through fast, secure, and future-facing implementation. Your ability to deliver high-quality technical solutions is exactly what works.
- Keep bringing your specific knowledge from Lighthouse to the table. You have high trust in this domain; use that experience to inform us what to keep and what to improve from our other projects.
- Keep voicing your thoughts during architecture discussions. There is a massive overlap between the programs regarding "what good looks like." We need you to speak up to help us learn from the work already done at the VA, ensuring we maximize our learning velocity and avoid repeating past mistakes.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Nick is a wizard with the keyboard, and I've had the privilege of seeing his impressive range of skills up close. His heroics and leadership were vital in digging the Lighthouse program out of some severe holes during our time at the VA, demonstrating his capacity to be an absolute force when fully engaged. Since joining Rise8 on FORGE, he has continued to be very helpful with ArgoCD and has done well pairing with other team members.




However, his day-to-day engagement and presence have been inconsistent recently. When Nick is focused, he is a formidable asset; when his focus is divided, it's a noticeable loss for the team. My primary wish is for more proactive communication. Even a brief heads-up on his bandwidth or availability would allow the team to better plan around him and offer support where needed. Despite these recent challenges, I still have immense faith in his skills and believe he is a valuable asset. I am hoping for a renewed focus and full engagement at the start of the year.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep applying your exceptional technical skills.** When fully engaged, your technical prowess is incredibly strong and a huge asset to the team, particularly with critical tools like ArgoCD.
- **Keep being willing to pair with teammates.** Your knowledge is valuable, and sharing it helps elevate the entire team.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start prioritizing proactive communication, especially when your focus or availability might be limited.** A brief heads-up on your bandwidth helps the team plan effectively and ensures we can support you.
- **Start re-engaging with the focus you're known for.** When you're present, you're a force. The team needs that historical focus and leadership brought to our current efforts.




#### **Stop Doing**
- **Stop operating in a silo when your bandwidth is low.** Instead of quietly disengaging, lean on the team and communicate what's needed. This will prevent your shifts in focus from having a significant impact on the team's momentum and morale.

I would also try and knock out the Security+ ASAP so you can get back to making great contributions in IL5/etc.

> Please **continue** to be our go-to expert for complex technical problems. Your ability to dig into a difficult issue, find a robust solution, and—just as importantly—align the entire team on your findings is a massive asset. We rely on your great ideas and your methodical approach to solving challenges that others are stuck on.




You have the deep technical know-how and strategic insight to be a primary driver of our team's direction. My only suggestion is to **start** acting on your instincts and believing in your voice more. You have absolutely earned the right to be more assertive; don't wait for the team to consensus—be the one to propose the solution, advocate for your vision, and drive it forward. We trust your judgment and want to see you lead the charge more often.

**Comment**:
> Luckey's output in terms of technical contribution has been quite low compared to other team members. While time spent preparing for Security+ is expected and supported by the team, it's been his priority for at least a month while accomplishing little other work, which has resulted in additional workload on the rest of the team. 




He often misses meetings and usually stays camera off and mic muted when he attends, limiting the team's ability to collaborate or work with him.

### Question 12

- Documenting finished work, leaving comments about what's getting done, and being clear about work status




Stop:
- Shell scripting when more robust tooling is available




Continue:
- Providing valuable insights on networking, technical knowledge, etc. that other team members miss or don't know
