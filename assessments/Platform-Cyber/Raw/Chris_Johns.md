**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would enthusiastically support rehiring me because I bring over 25 years of specialized DoD Systems Engineering experience, which offers immediate, high-value technical contribution. Beyond my expertise, I maintain a strong, positive attitude and actively seek opportunities to both mentor others and learn new skills, demonstrating a commitment to my own growth and the overall betterment of the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Doing:
I plan to start taking a more proactive leadership role within the team, specifically from a Platform Engineering perspective. This involves:




Leading technical design discussions, championing best practices for scalability and resilience, and mentoring junior engineers in platform fundamentals.




Proactively researching and staying on top of merging technologies and processes to ensure our platform and processes remain cutting-edge and align with current DoD modernization efforts.




Stop Doing:
I will stop second-guessing my understanding of Rise8's needs and expectations. Instead, I will rely confidently on my 25+ years of experience to make decisive recommendations and clearly articulate the technical approach.








Keep Doing:
I will keep consistently driving the project forward, maintaining the current momentum and quality of my technical contributions. This includes efficiently resolving roadblocks, delivering key platform features on schedule, and ensuring alignment with the overall project roadmap.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Accelerating Core Platform Design with a Terraform POC
Accomplishment: During the initial Bifrost design, I leveraged my knowledge of Claude code and rapidly developed a Proof of Concept (POC) in under four hours using Terraform. This POC demonstrated the feasibility of using AWS Cognito, ECR, and IAM policies for secure customer onboarding and access control.








Mission Impact: This initiative did two things: first, it immediately validated and established the foundational security design for the Bifrost platform, minimizing design debate and risk. Second, it served as the team’s introduction and practical training to Terraform, elevating the team's infrastructure-as-code capabilities and accelerating future platform development. The POC ultimately became the production architecture.








2. Maintaining Development Velocity During Critical Platform Blockages
Accomplishment: When the challenging deployment of GitLab in the Palantir Apollo environment blocked the development team, I took the initiative to rapidly provision a test EC2 instance of GitLab and a GitLab runner using Rise8's existing AWS resources, Terraform, and Claude code.








Mission Impact: This action eliminated a critical bottleneck that had stalled multiple development stories, enabling engineers to continue development immediately. This prevented a significant loss of velocity and ensured continuous progress toward mission deliverables while the Platform team resolved the long-term Apollo deployment challenges.








3. Building a Safe, Realistic Training and Testing Environment
Accomplishment: I created a dedicated demo section in our team’s GitLab repository featuring a test Helm deployment that accurately mirrored our production environment, allowing the team to run it locally in a Minikube environment. I later tailored this environment for focused training.








Mission Impact: This provided the entire team with an accessible, safe environment for testing and debugging their deployments without risking production or staging systems, improving code quality and confidence. Most notably, it served as an invaluable training tool for our skill bridger, enabling him to quickly build practical, hands-on experience and confidence with Kubernetes and Helm, accelerating his readiness to contribute to the Rise8 mission.

**Comment**:
> Chris loves what he does and I believe because he loves what he does, he excels in his work. He constantly is tinkering which leads to learning. He is the 10,000 rep person. I believe if Chris gets assigned a task, that task will be done. I love that I am on a team with Chris.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: Tinkering and learning. Being passionate about what you do. Loving your work so much that you lose time of the hours you've worked.




Start: Possibly start teaching all the great things you've self-taught but even this is a hard one because you already do. 




Stop: You're very self-critical and self-deprecating. Most of the time I believe it's humorous in nature, but I think you're a rockstar. Maybe the depreciation is what fuels you but I do believe you're a little hard on yourself. It never crosses the line though, and I do take it all as jokes.

**Comment**:
> Despite being a relatively recent addition, Chris has made an immediate and positive impact. I've been consistently impressed by his combination of technical skill and personal drive. He clearly loves what he does and, as a result, does it exceptionally well.
His growth mindset and ability to maintain a positive, progress-oriented attitude—even in difficult circumstances—are a huge asset to our team's culture and resilience.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### Start
- Start leveraging your expertise to help define our platform's "opinion." I'd love to see you take a strong stance on what we as a platform team *can* and *should* deliver, and just as importantly, what we *don't.*
- You have the skill to be exceptionally influential here. Specifically, you could help lead the charge in delivering highly optimized solutions for our *current* systems. Instead of always chasing the new, your focus on mastering and refining what we already have would provide immense, lasting value to our users.
### Stop
- Stop (or at least be mindful of) the impulse to jump on every new idea that comes your way. This is the natural tradeoff for the "Start" recommendation. Your passion for learning is a huge asset, but channeling that energy into optimizing our core services will make a bigger impact than spreading yourself thin across too many new frontiers.
### Keep
- Absolutely keep bringing that passion, positivity, and growth mindset. Your ability to find progress in even the worst situations is a massive asset. We need that energy, and your drive to learn and do the work well is what makes you such a valuable part of the team.

**Comment**:
> Chris has consistently stepped up to resolve issues for the Bifrost team.  When we first realized we couldn't use Gitlab in the IL5 environment, there was some reluctance to shift over to our corporate environment, but he just made it happen and unblocked the team.  That move set us up for several months of productive work while the issues with Gitlab kept unspooling.

### Question 12

> Chris has been an incredibly important member of the Bifrost team. He takes on some of the hardest/most cumbersome tasks with a positive attitude and no complaints. He tackled reinstalling Gitlab, and even when there was a massive problem and required more work, he approached it with the grit to get it done. He also completed the documentation of this reinstall, in order to ensure that the rest of the team is set up for success/won't be down for long should another Gitlab issue occur again in the future. These approaches allow the team to keep progressing forward and we wouldn't be able to without Chris

> I think I am most impressed with Chris' skill to pick up new technologies and initiatives by Rise8. You really jumped head first into the AI initiative, using Claude during this project and I feel like you have surpassed others (including me) in terms of prompting and usage of the tool. 




One initiative that jumped out at me was when the team was stuck on not having a gitlab instance, you really saved us by standing up a local AWS instance for us, which opened up a whole other track of work when we really needed it. You carved out your own time/work, to make a greater impact for the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Stop: 
- Making too many README-esque files. The codebase sometimes gets cluttered with different kinds of help/troubleshooting guides that claude made. To continue to make the repos more human readable, I think that it would go a long way to just have a singular consolidated trouble shooting guide. It also forces you to reevaluate your current guide to make sure its up to date. 




Continue: 
- share out your personal learnings with the team and speaking out when you want to clarify things. I think that your voice on the team is really impactful being one of the platform engineers with lots of GovTech experience. So when you learn something, it feels like the whole team is learning something all over again. Even when you repeat something that is already said, it makes us revisit the topic and really think if we explained/thought about it thoroughly. 




Start: 
- lead architecture discussions. Your intuition on the platform is really strong. It seems like you understand what processes are required to achieve an ATO from an engineering perspective. I think you can lead a discussion on how Bifrost should ideally work, and leading architecture discussions would help everyone else align on a vision.

**Comment**:
> Chris is a very solid and knowledgeable contributor to the Bifrost team. As stated himself, he excels when being handed interesting problems or tasks that require time and energy to unpack, discover, and implement. Very good at finding various solutions to problems and communicate the pros and cons of these solutions. However, I would like to see Chris put more effort into offering a opinion as a technical leader as to how something should move forward and more clearly take the reigns to drive an effort to completion. I think more involvement in the product process of story writing, pre-ipm would allow Chris to make sure that things left in an non-ideal state continue to move towards the ideal state. Chris himself has stated a disinterest in engaging with people external to the team which in turn creates less opportunity for him to engage with discussion that prepare us for external engagement.

> I would recommend Chris start to take a more present and active approach in the product process on the team. Pair with our PM on fleshing out epics, help write stories for IPM, facilitate an open-ended architectural discussion, help prepare for a stakeholder meeting. There is a tremendous amount of context when engaging in those spaces that in turn create more efficient and focused engineering efforts, and I would say that focus on the mission would be the primary thing for Chris to work on. Additionally, Chris could put more effort into giving intentional and timely feedback. Considering putting dedicated 1:1s on the calendar, sharing how pairing week after a session, etc.




Keep crushing those individual tasks and deep dives into complex subjects. I love your persistence in writing good ADRs for big discussion and quickly sharing them out. I also find pairing with you very easy and breezy, good communication and focus.
