**Comment**:
> I feel that I have stepped into a leadership role on the team. SecRel team members as well as members of other teams look to me to facilitate collaboration and learning. I have been called upon to represent the team and project in multiple customer facing and internal meetings with rise8 leadership. I always try to foster an environment of growth, whether I'm learning from someone or they're learning from me. I try to be as proactive as possible in identifying team shortfalls and areas of improvement along with taking on hard tasking to ensure the team supports desired outcomes.

✓ Being transparent about technical constraints and challenges




START DOING:
→ Documenting technical decisions and architectural patterns for knowledge sharing
→ Setting clearer boundaries between work and personal time
→ Encouraging teammates to take on more infrastructure work to develop other team members' skills
→ Take on more programming work to develop my skills




STOP DOING:
✗ Taking on too much infrastructure work alone
✗ Creating automations and tools that don't fit the current secrel cli polylith model.

### Question 13

> Modularized the SecRel pipeline so that it can be re-utilized on different efforts within Rise8. This work can be utilized on an effort like ATTV to assist Rise8 in bring value to customers quickly with a pipeline that has been proven.




   Provided essential technical guidance to multiple team members on challenging problems, including helping troubleshoot postgres container deployment with security constraints, supporting various infrastructure issues, and guiding the team through security policy implementation.




   Consistently led daily stand-ups, weekly syncs and larger portfolio and stakeholder facing meetings with organization and clarity, maintaining team coordination and communication. This leadership ensures the team stays aligned, blockers are identified early, and knowledge sharing happens regularly.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Andrew's stellar performance is well known and widely appreciated. He can bounce between several tasks at once and drive outcomes in multiple dimensions. The only major growth point would be to make sure the code, Dockerfiles, and scripts are more modular enough and reusable. There are several instances of code being produced by AI several times, all slightly differently, creating the possibility for subtle issues and bugs.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: Generally being awesome
Stop: Working too many angles? Don't want you burning yourself out.
Start: Exploring more long term implications of the code produced. Just because it works doesn't mean it will always continue to work in all cases, and getting that closer to reality can produce big impacts.

**Comment**:
> Drew, working with you daily has given me a front-row seat to your ability to see the big picture and anticipate how different factors affect our pipeline before anyone else does. You're our canary in the coal mine who spots issues like Artifactory file size limits that could make our pipeline inoperable. This proactive, systems-level thinking is invaluable.




You're a trailblazer who isn't afraid to lead into unknown territory. Whether it's automating runner creation or hardening our software supply chain, you take ownership of complex, ambiguous problems and bring them to the finish line. The kudos from our team retrospectives say it all: You're the Swiss Army Knife who shows up everywhere we need you most, from helping teammates debug typos to ensuring our pipeline infrastructure stays secure and operational.




What impresses me most is how you balance being a force multiplier for the team while maintaining focus through WIP limits. You've built trust to handle bigger challenges, and I'm excited to see you take on even more strategic, transformative work in the coming year.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start:** Taking even bigger risks and leading more strategic, program-level initiatives from conception to completion. You have the technical depth, systems thinking, and team trust to tackle the ambiguous and high-impact challenges. Don't wait for permission because you're already shaping direction.
- **Stop:** Limiting the size of your dreams and what you believe you're capable of achieving. Your track record proves you can own and deliver transformative solutions. Think bigger about the problems you want to solve and the impact you want to create.
- **Keep:** 
   - being our systems thinker who spots risks and opportunities before others do. Keep building automation that has strategic, program-level impact. 
   - being the teammate who shows up to help others while maintaining your focus on high-value work. 
   - elevating yourself and the entire team through your technical leadership and collaborative spirit.

**Comment**:
> I can't say enough about Drew so I will attempt to keep this focused.  Long story short, he is an absolute superstar in every way.  His technical skills, amiable personality, leadership mindset, ability to focus on both the fine details and long-term goals of the program as well as the mission of the company all at the same time is simply unbelievable.  In my opinion, he has outgrown his current rank.  It would be inconceivable to let a guy like this go after the conclusion of the FORGE program.  If he isn't an A Player, then I simply don't know what an A Player is...and I believe I know an A player when I see one.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Stop: I think he might be overextended a bit.  He might be taking on more things, both at Rise8 and elsewhere, that he should, and we want him for the long-term. This company should never, ever let him go.  
Start: Not sure what to put here.
Keep: He is excellent in pairing, always ready to help no matter what the need. Always ready to pitch in at a moment's notice.

Keep Doing: Keep learning and asking for feedback, you seem very eager to improve anyway you can.
