**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> While I have worked as a Riser for just about a month, the culture has been infectious and increasingly clear as to the principles we align with and the outcomes (in prod) we seek to deliver.
My demonstration of A-player traits has been exemplified by focusing on bringing immediate value to the mission and my teams as quickly as possible with my SME background in the mission area. I've paired this with learning what it means to be an A-player at Rise8 and building my baseline understanding of the vision and ethos of what we do and how to meet or exceed the customer needs along the way.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> This next year, I plan to...




**start**
- Delegating technical work and problems to the team as my own bucket fills up.
- Enacting the remainder of the Rise8 A-player characteristics that I have learned (and still am learning)
- Improving communication to team & customer the vision and needs being addressed and work towards "one sentence" need statements to get there.




**stop**
- Defining solutions by the limitations of the current environments and instead plan + engineer solutions that better meet the Customer's real needs.




**continue**
- Self-starting efforts and investigations to help the mission succeed & unblock teams.
- Sharing my knowledge and domain expertise to help all teams around me succeed.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. In a matter of weeks, I brought deep domain expertise into multiple FORGE teams and helped guide the focus and efforts towards the customer's needs and expectations, which has already been very well received. This was achieved through SME Office Hours hosted of my own volition.
2. Successfully demo'd some system services to the customer and received excellent feedback.
3. Architected a code sharing solution to unblock the FORGE Tiger Team (FWS) development needs using standard git tooling (patches/bundles). This has allowed our team to develop code more traditionally and succeed in delivering our first demo while reducing risk & duplication of efforts when migrating to IL5 GitLab in the future.

Start: Jake has showed some interest in more product-like activities. If the opportunity presents, it would be great to have Jake be a part of more balanced team activities that blur lines between engineering, product and design.

He jumped right in, setting up office hours for the whole Rise8 FORGE team to ask questions and quickly organized knowledge transfer sessions on key FORGE topics.

**Comment**:
> Jake, I know you've only been here for four weeks, but that's been more than enough time to make a significant positive impression. This 'end-of-year' feedback is less about 'past performance' and more about solidifying those first impressions and setting a trajectory for a successful next year.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Keep Doing**




- **De-risking the Engagement:** Your deep domain and legacy system knowledge is already proving invaluable. Please **keep** acting as that "sanity check" for the team. (framework services team but importantly platform team too) The way you advise on potential speed bumps and help mitigate risk is a huge asset.
- **Bringing Proactive Value:** **Keep** being so proactive and engaged. You bring value to every meeting you attend, not just from your domain expertise but also from your strong technical engineering capabilities.
- **Maintaining a Collaborative & Curious Mindset:** **Keep** being 100% engaged and collaborative. Your curiosity, combined with your practical experience, is the perfect mix for this team. You are already leading from a knowledge standpoint, and we want you to continue to lean into that.




### **Start Doing**




- **Synthesizing Your Knowledge with the 'Rise 8 OS':** For the next year, a primary strategic goal will be to **start** actively merging your deep platform knowledge with the Rise 8 Mission OS and execution strategy.
- **Championing Rise 8 Practices:** As you focus on getting the FORGE framework services running, **start** using that work as an opportunity to actively inject and champion our core practices (like TDD, XP, and lean product development).
- **Becoming a "Bridge":** **Start** positioning yourself as the engineer who "gets it" from all sides—the legacy, the platform, and the Rise 8 methodology. Your success here will be in helping to execute the strategy, not just the code, and becoming a key bridge between your technical expertise and our company's way of working.




### **Stop Doing**




- Given you've only been here a month, I have no "stop doing" feedback—your start has been exceptional.
- My only advice in this category is more of a "focus" suggestion for handling your high volume of great ideas: As you continue to advise on strategy and identify new opportunities, **avoid** letting those insights get lost or sidetrack the team's immediate objectives. The best way to do this is to **continue (or start) to channel them** directly into our process. Log them in the team's icebox or communicate them to the Product/Portfolio team so they can be prioritized and actioned effectively. This ensures all your strategic value is captured.

**Comment**:
> Although Jake has only been on the team for a short time, I have been very impressed with his contributions and attitude. He possesses solid technical skills and a clear drive to see our mission succeed.




What has been incredibly valuable is his preexisting knowledge of FORGE from his time at SDL. More importantly, he has shown a great willingness to share that knowledge with the entire team and is a fantastic teacher, with a real skill for communicating complex ideas clearly. He consistently takes the initiative to leverage his unique experience and find ways to make an impact on the broader program. Based on this very strong start, I have seen nothing but positive contributions from him.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep leveraging your unique FORGE knowledge.** Your willingness to share your experience from SDL has been a massive accelerator for the team. Please continue to be that resource.
- **Keep taking the initiative to make an impact.** Your proactive approach to finding ways to benefit the program is highly effective and valued.
- **Keep being a great teacher.** Your ability to explain ideas clearly is a huge asset, both in one-on-one and group settings.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start taking lead ownership of a larger feature or component.** You've already proven your ability to contribute and teach. The next step is to channel that into a formal ownership role, guiding a piece of work from design to delivery. This will be a great way to deepen your impact on the team (but honestly you're already taking care of this by owning stuff like the helm charts, so this my be a mute point)...




#### **Stop Doing**
- I haven't seen anything that you should stop doing. Your approach has been a perfect model for how to integrate into a new team and make an immediate, positive impact. Keep up the great work.
