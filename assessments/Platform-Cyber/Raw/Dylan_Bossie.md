### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start:
- Seeking more public speaking and leadership opportunities within FORGE and Rise8




Stop:
- Being reactive to new information or requests, instead handling with clear communication and kindness




Keep Doing:
- Rapidly growing my technical skills
- Taking increasing responsibility for my team

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Implemented FORGE authentication/authorization for OCP, RedHat IdM, and GitLab in fully automated, production-ready fashion via Helm, Terraform, and Ansible, accelerating implementation of RBAC and ACM alignment in DAFCW environment with the on-prem site to get us to IATT and ATO more rapidly as we achieve alignment with on-prem security officers and consistently implement accurate least-permissions RBAC.
2. Implemented environment-wide FORGE SCAP scans for servers and OCP nodes including garbage collection, consolidated exports to a centralized environment (including establishing zero-trust communication) in fully automated, production-ready fashion via Ansible and Helm, providing automated, repeatable, production-ready security scans with a single command to deploy into any AWS account, accelerating time to delivery for our security officers of necessary scans to evaluate our environment, which is critical for IATT and ATO.
3. Implemented full end-to-end automation of the FORGE PDH, from the Terraform to deploy the EC2 to the Ansible that installs and configures all dependencies needed for the PDH to deploy the rest of the environment. This rapidly accelerates deployment into the DAFCW environment, significantly reducing bootstrapping time for each account and shifting overall timelines left to IATT, ATO, and outcome delivery.

He is always one to be a proponent of pairing, and getting ahead of any knowledge silos on the team.

**Comment**:
> Dylan is an outstanding engineer and an invaluable member of this team. His technical prowess is genuinely exceptional; he has continued to grow impressively during our time as teammates, and I believe his skills have elevated to be among the best in the entire company.




This has been especially clear in his recent work. He has been a master of bootstrapping critical efforts, taking the lead on preparing the PDH package and its automation, and wrangling all the necessary container images to get the job done. His ability to collaborate and his commitment to our mission are tremendous. He has a rare ability to spot needs across the FORGE program and is always willing to do what it takes to rise to the occasion.




Crucially, his willingness to do the hard things extends to jumping into new, tricky technologies he doesn't fully understand; he doesn't hide from a challenge, he runs towards it. On a personal level, Dylan is a force multiplier for the team. His top-notch attitude and resilience give me more confidence just by working alongside him. He's a genuinely good coworker to be around—hilarious, fun, and a major contributor to our positive team dynamic.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep operating at an elite technical level.** Your ability to solve our most complex problems is a cornerstone of this team's success.
- **Keep proactively identifying and solving program-level issues.** Your vision for the success of FORGE is clear and your initiative is critical.
- **Keep fearlessly tackling new and unfamiliar challenges.** Your willingness to jump into the unknown and figure things out is a massive asset and a great example for the team.
- **Keep being the positive, resilient, and collaborative core of this team.** Your attitude is infectious and makes our work more enjoyable and successful.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start intentionally scaling your impact through mentorship.** You have a wealth of knowledge that can elevate the entire team. Start looking for opportunities to formalize this, whether by leading short tech talks, writing down patterns for others to follow, or taking another engineer under your wing. This will multiply your impact beyond your own keyboard.
- **Improve your confidence in front of strangers**. You're a great speaker when you come in confident. I think that you could have an even bigger impact if you take the time to be intentional about improving your public speaking skills and seek opportunities to lean into uncomfortable social situations. I genuinely think that's one of the next frontiers for you, technical skills reach their pinnacle when you can verbalize to anyone what you're trying to do and why you're trying to do (both technical and non-technical people).




#### **Stop Doing**
- **Stop being the *only* person who can solve certain problems.** As a natural consequence of your expertise, you can become the default for our hardest issues. To avoid becoming a bottleneck and to help others grow, consciously look for opportunities to delegate or pair-program on these challenges. Empowering others to solve them will free you up to tackle the *next* major strategic challenge.

> Dylan's value extends far beyond their own excellent work; they are a true team multiplier. They have a remarkable skill for giving clear, constructive feedback that helps everyone improve. Moreover, they were incredibly generous with their time, always willing to share their deep domain expertise and mentor others. I learned so much from them and would be thrilled to be on their team again.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Please **continue** to be such a powerful force for quality and clarity on this team. Your clear, direct feedback is invaluable, and your willingness to mentor and share your deep domain expertise actively helps others level up. I also deeply value your willingness to speak up in our IPMs and other meetings. Voicing your perspective and potential concerns about long-term decisions is critical—it consistently helps us spot risks, adjust our plans, and make more robust choices.




As you move forward, I'd love for you to **start** looking for ways to scale this influence even further. Perhaps to scale your mentorship, consider championing a "learning session" or creating a durable piece of documentation on a core area you specialize in. This would help extend your positive impact beyond your direct interactions.
