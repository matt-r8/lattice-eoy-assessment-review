**Comment**:
> Jerod is an absolute rockstar, and it's difficult to imagine what the team would look like without him now. In the time we've worked together, he has firmly established himself as part of the fabric of our team through his sharp skills, strategic thinking, and phenomenal attitude.




He has a standout ability to ask insightful questions that help clarify complex situations and illuminate the best path forward. His technical skills are so sharp that he makes difficult tasks look easy. However, what truly speaks to his character is his willingness to be a team player. He volunteered for tedious framework service work early on—a task that wasn't "sexy" but was critical for our success. That says everything about his commitment to the mission.




On top of all that, he's a dope coworker who is genuinely funny and great to be around. He brings a positive energy that makes the whole team better.




Super grateful I get the opportunity to work him.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep asking the insightful questions.** Your ability to probe and understand the "why" behind our work is a massive asset that helps the entire team think more strategically.
- **Keep being an exceptional team player.** Your willingness to take on the necessary but unglamorous work is a powerful example and a cornerstone of your value to the team.
- **Keep being a positive and fun presence.** The energy and humor you bring to our interactions make a real difference in team morale and cohesion.




#### **Start Doing**
- **Start looking for opportunities to mentor other engineers.** You have the technical skills, the right mindset, and the ability to ask good questions—all the makings of a great mentor. In the near future, taking another Riser under your wing would be a fantastic way to scale your impact across the company.




#### **Stop Doing**
- Nothing. Your current approach to your work and your team is fantastic. Keep doing what you're doing.

### Question 12

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: Strategic Planning Insights: Jerod consistently brings keen insights to planning activities, including IPM and scoping sessions. Their enthusiastic contribution to the risks and mitigations workshop was invaluable.




Start: Deepen Product Strategy Exposure: Jeros is on the right course to level up as an engineer. To support this growth, I'd like to see them proactively seek exposure to more of the product process and strategy. This means not just contributing to what we build (tasks), but influencing why we build it (strategy).

**Comment**:
> Jerod is a solid A Player on the FORGE team. He was new to Rise8 when joining and has had to pick up on a lot of context but he is always willing to learn and take on new challenges. He was making valuable contributions to the platform team before moving to tiger team, where I'm sure he is making just as many contributions as well. Even though he was newer he wasn't afraid to speak up on risks or technical direction which was great.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **KEEP: Proactive Execution & Technical Agility**




- **Keep bringing your "One Team" mentality.** Your willingness to jump in and assist not just our team, but also the platform team when they were at capacity (resolving bugs, getting services running, and doing research), was invaluable. It builds massive trust across the organization.
- **Keep maintaining your speed to competency.** Getting CompTIA Security+ certified in a matter of weeks was impressive and showed your dedication to the engagement.
- **Keep delivering.** You have a bias for action that is refreshing. I value that we can pair program or I can hand off a task, and I know you will get the code shipped without getting stuck in analysis paralysis.




#### **STOP: Viewing "Output" as the Primary Goal**




- *Note: You don't have negative habits or bottlenecks, but as you grow, "stopping" certain mindsets is key to leveling up.*
- **Stop (or be careful of) solving problems just because you *can*.** Because you are so technically capable and willing to help, there is a risk of spreading yourself too thin or working on things that don't drive the main objective. Pause before jumping in to ensure the task aligns with our highest priorities.




#### **START: Focusing on Outcomes (Mission OS)**




- **Start leaning heavily into the Rise 8 Operating Model (Mission OS).** You have mastered the "how" (technical execution); next year, I want to see you master the "why" (strategy).
- **Start practicing "scope hammering."** Instead of just completing the scope given, look for ways to limit scope to the absolute minimum required to achieve the desired outcome.
- **Start driving specific outcomes.** Shift your focus to "did this work achieve the specific outcome we targeted?" This mindset shift will help you thrive in this environment. (understanding how rise8 scores supporting or user outcomes and how to get credit for those in rise 8 engagements / prod patrol / etc..)

> Jerod's ability to onboard and deliver value was nothing short of remarkable. He jumped in from day one, rapidly immersing himself in our complex problem space and proactively completing necessary certifications.

**Comment**:
> Please **continue** to be our model for proactiveness and ownership. Your ability to jump into a new, complex domain and become a valuable contributor almost immediately has been a massive asset. We rely heavily on your resourcefulness in hunting down answers, whether in documentation or from other experts, and your consistency in communicating your status and progress is exactly what we need to stay aligned.




**Start:** Now that you've built such a strong foundation, I'd love to see you **start** leveraging that expertise to influence team direction more broadly. When you seek out answers and find gaps, start to formalize those findings—propose the documentation update, suggest the process improvement, or take ownership of the "right" long-term plan. This will shift you from being a fantastic problem-solver to being a key driver of our team's long-term strategy and technical health.

> Jerod has stepped into a parallel effort to 'normal' platform engineering and taken on a breadth of technically challenging work to help the team succeed and mission advance while also advancing his own technical knowledge every week.

**Comment**:
> Keep being an excellent, fun team member! Excellent energy to work with, and regular effort to learn & apply tools and technologies is valuable to the team momentum. Also keep working extremely well in technical pairing and raising meaningful guiding questions the team should be considering, your insights are invaluable to keeping everyone balanced and .




The only thing to keep an eye on in future engagements with both customers and internally is to be more willing to assert yourself (even if uncomfortable) to ensure your perspective is heard and the Rise8 principles/mission vision is kept in focus. Don't want to see good thoughts and ideas squandered just because the loudest voices didn't take a break.




All around you are an absolute A+ player and looking forward to seeing a ton more success in technical pairing and as a Riser over the coming year!
