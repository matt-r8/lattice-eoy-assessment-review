1. Deploying part of the FWS apps to a local OCP cluster. I think this gave the FWS team a lot of confidence in our work and will be a big part of what we build on going forward.
2. Jumped in to support the Tiger team/FWS effort while still contributing to the Platform team. Was able to help navigate the murky waters of FORGE with my platform knowledge.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Asare Nkansah:**
Jerod is an absolute rockstar, and it's difficult to imagine what the team would look like without him now. In the time we've worked together, he has firmly established himself as part of the fabric of our team through his sharp skills, strategic thinking, and phenomenal attitude.




He has a standout ability to ask insightful questions that help clarify complex situations and illuminate the best path forward. His technical skills are so sharp that he makes difficult tasks look easy. However, what truly speaks to his character is his willingness to be a team player. He volunteered for tedious framework service work early on—a task that wasn't "sexy" but was critical for our success. That says everything about his commitment to the mission.




On top of all that, he's a dope coworker who is genuinely funny and great to be around. He brings a positive energy that makes the whole team better.




Super grateful I get the opportunity to work him.

**Kevin Gates:**
Jerod has been great to work with. He reliably contributes keen insights during product discussions and been a great contributor overall, presenting demos to client, etc.

**Eric Whitman:**
Jerod is a solid A Player on the FORGE team. He was new to Rise8 when joining and has had to pick up on a lot of context but he is always willing to learn and take on new challenges. He was making valuable contributions to the platform team before moving to tiger team, where I'm sure he is making just as many contributions as well. Even though he was newer he wasn't afraid to speak up on risks or technical direction which was great.

**Dylan Bossie:**
Jerod is a great addition to the team, although mostly does Tiger Team tasks so we don't get to leverage his skills :(

**Nick Luckey:**
I greatly enjoy working with Jerod.




Jerod possesses a strong intellectual curiosity. He consistently demonstrates great initiative in seeking out more knowledge, which often leads to innovative solutions and a broader perspective on our tasks. His proactive approach to learning directly benefits the quality and depth of his work.




Furthermore, Jerod is a funny and engaging team member. His humor and positive demeanor make team meetings and collaborations enjoyable and productive. Other team members appreciate the intellectual contributions he brings, as well as the lightness and enthusiasm he maintains, even when tackling complex problems.

**Adam Gardner:**
n/a

**Nick Weiss:**
Jerod's ability to onboard and deliver value was nothing short of remarkable. He jumped in from day one, rapidly immersing himself in our complex problem space and proactively completing necessary certifications. His combination of resourcefulness—actively seeking out answers—and crystal-clear communication makes him an incredibly effective and reliable teammate. I would enthusiastically seek out any opportunity to have him on my team again.

**Brandon Shouse:**
- Jerod hit the ground running, diving right into the FORGE work while not on the Tiger team, and continues to do so on the Tiger team
- He has the tech chops, and continues to expand his knowledge, even in the short time heas been here

**Jake Cook:**
Jerod has stepped into a parallel effort to 'normal' platform engineering and taken on a breadth of technically challenging work to help the team succeed and mission advance while also advancing his own technical knowledge every week. The only reason to not have rated Jerod hire on some aspects is due to the short time to observe some of his A player traits, but there is nothing seen which would show he won't exemplify being  Leader or higher in every way.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

**KEEP:**

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Kevin Gates:**
Keep: Strategic Planning Insights: Jerod consistently brings keen insights to planning activities, including IPM and scoping sessions. Their enthusiastic contribution to the risks and mitigations workshop was invaluable.




Start: Deepen Product Strategy Exposure: Jeros is on the right course to level up as an engineer. To support this growth, I'd like to see them proactively seek exposure to more of the product process and strategy. This means not just contributing to what we build (tasks), but influencing why we build it (strategy).

**Eric Whitman:**
Continue learning and tackling new challenges outside of your skillset. Even though you are a PE III, your opinion still matters and is valued greatly! Don't shy away from speaking up on any technical direction or opinions you come across. Keep up the great work and glad to have you on the team!

**Dylan Bossie:**
Start: Working on the platform team :D




Stop: Idk




Continue: 
- Being a quality pair partner
- Speaking up when you think a decision isn't right or best practice

**Nick Luckey:**
Jerod should keep bringing his positive, funny, and intellectually engaged energy to collaborations**.** His demeanor makes him an excellent thought partner and helps keep the team environment stimulating and fun.

**Nick Weiss:**
Please **continue** to be our model for proactiveness and ownership. Your ability to jump into a new, complex domain and become a valuable contributor almost immediately has been a massive asset. We rely heavily on your resourcefulness in hunting down answers, whether in documentation or from other experts, and your consistency in communicating your status and progress is exactly what we need to stay aligned.




**Start:** Now that you've built such a strong foundation, I'd love to see you **start** leveraging that expertise to influence team direction more broadly. When you seek out answers and find gaps, start to formalize those findings—propose the documentation update, suggest the process improvement, or take ownership of the "right" long-term plan. This will shift you from being a fantastic problem-solver to being a key driver of our team's long-term strategy and technical health.

**Brandon Shouse:**
- Keep the drive/energy going!

**Jake Cook:**
Keep being an excellent, fun team member! Excellent energy to work with, and regular effort to learn & apply tools and technologies is valuable to the team momentum. Also keep working extremely well in technical pairing and raising meaningful guiding questions the team should be considering, your insights are invaluable to keeping everyone balanced and .




The only thing to keep an eye on in future engagements with both customers and internally is to be more willing to assert yourself (even if uncomfortable) to ensure your perspective is heard and the Rise8 principles/mission vision is kept in focus. Don't want to see good thoughts and ideas squandered just because the loudest voices didn't take a break.




All around you are an absolute A+ player and looking forward to seeing a ton more success in technical pairing and as a Riser over the coming year!
