**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Outcomes in production hasn't been meet on the FORGE program due to delays in obtaining DAF Cloud Works accounts.




I tend to rate myself lower than my peers, or maybe my peers rate me at or around the same.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Being more collaborative, I can tell this is still a weakness of mine. I tend to work best alone, but realize there have been moments where pairing with others have helped me get unstuck faster than prompting AI or reading through documentation to help me troubleshoot. 




Stop: Being so hard on myself. I sometimes have this goal of achieving perfecting rather than focusing on progression, so it can become very overwhelming for me when I'm not meeting that goal. 




Keep Doing: One team member of mine told me I give the most creative ideas, I have heard this in the past, so I want to keep delivering on creative ideas. I believe this will be a strength of mine in the future once I reach Staff level and above because it gives me the ability to develop something that hasn't been done or isn't very well known.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Starting the initial development of an AI tool to assist FORGE cybersecurity on doing their RMF work by generating documents such as Plan of Actions and Milestones (POAM) and Security Assessment Reports (SAR) and even asking a chatbot certain key questions regarding RMF using NIST documents. 
2. Developing tools for the SecRel pipeline on FORGE to meet Minimal Viable Product (MVP) goals. Those tools include Cosign, parallel container building, OpenSCAP scans that run in parallel, and virus scanning with ClamAV. 
3. Developing the initial ideas of how to have FORGE tenants run the SecRel pipeline and inspiring the idea of moving towards Alpine Linux for the base image of all our containers. 
4. Deploying SD Elements, I put this last because I don't know how this will be used in FORGE, I overhear it's not something required for this program.

**Comment**:
> Sean is an aolid contributor who exemplifies innovation and mission focus. His leadership in developing the "Checkm8" agentic AI capability demonstrates boldness, technical excellence, and pragmatic product thinking. While this effort did not directly relate to the initial deployment of the project, it will be the cornerstone of work ahead on the project.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> KEEP DOING:
✓ Driving innovation with AI capabilities - your leadership on Checkm8 is transformative for the mission
✓ Helping teammates with technical challenges - your willingness to support others amplifies team effectiveness
✓ Pragmatic approach to implementation and costing - this ensures sustainable, production-ready solutions
✓ Excellent communication about progress and blockers - your transparency enables team coordination and support
✓ Growth mindset and continuous learning - you're constantly expanding capabilities and applying new technologies
✓ Product thinking - considering the full lifecycle from development to adoption to maintenance




START DOING:
→ Documenting AI/ML learnings for the broader Rise8 community - your expertise is valuable organization-wide
→ Considering how to scale your innovation approach - how can you help others innovate similarly?
→ Building more formal feedback loops for Checkm8 users - systematic feedback will accelerate iteration
→ Sharing your journey at more company-wide forums - your story could inspire innovation across Rise8
→ Mentoring others interested in AI/ML - develop the next generation of AI practitioners
→ Product thinking - considering the full lifecycle from development to adoption to maintenance and how our current work relates to the end state




STOP DOING:
✗ Taking on too many concurrent initiatives - while you handle multiple workstreams well, consider focusing to increase individual impact and avoid burnout, this also flows into your git hygeine. Too many "features" in your working branch can be detrimental when it comes time to merge the changes.

> Sean is a terrific guy to work with.  He is enthusiastic, personable and a hard worker.  He led the charge into AI for our group, developing an AI-based MCP server known as CheckM8 that can take the personas of a Cybersecurity Engineer, Product Manager and more.  He will explore any possibility and isn't afraid to learn or ask, and is honest and direct.  He will take on any challenge and is unafraid of anything.

**Comment**:
> Sean, your ability to pivot and reprioritize has been one of your greatest contributions. You've demonstrated flexibility by setting aside your passion project, CheckM8, to tackle MVP items like OpenSCAP integration, ClamAV, and pipeline infrastructure work. Without your willingness to shift gears and handle what the team needed most, we would be behind schedule, missing key security features, and operating with a weaker security posture.




Your technical versatility is impressive. You've moved among complex AI development, pipeline engineering, security tool integration, and troubleshooting. The kudos from the team reflect this: "shifting gears about 18,000 times a day" and "agility during shifting priorities" are recognition of your ability to deliver across different problem spaces.




What makes this even more valuable is that you think strategically. Your unconventional thinking and ability to rally the team, like getting everyone behind the CheckM8 name, show leadership qualities that go beyond individual contributor work.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start:** 
   - specializing in one of your new areas of expertise and leading it end-to-end. You've built a strong foundation across AI, pipeline engineering, and security tooling. Now is the time to go deeper in one domain and deliver not just functional solutions, but polished, refined work that showcases the finer points of your craft. Consider which area energizes you most and where you can create the most strategic impact and then own it completely.
   - cultivating an inner dialogue that reminds you of your goals and capabilities rather than your perceived shortcomings. When you catch yourself downplaying an accomplishment, like the intrinsic value of CheckM8, pause and reframe: What would you think if a teammate had built this? You undersell yourself, and shifting that internal narrative will unlock your next level of growth and impact.
- **Stop:** letting self-limiting beliefs cloud your perspective on your contributions and accomplishments. Your work speaks for itself, from building CheckM8 from scratch to rescuing critical pipeline issues to integrating complex security tools. Trust in the evidence of what you've delivered and the feedback your teammates give you.
- **Keep:** taking initiative to advance our mission, especially when no one volunteers. This quality is invaluable to the team. Your willingness to step up to SDE setup that "wants to fight you every step of the way" or working through OpenSCAP "like a Rocky movie" keeps us moving forward when others might hesitate.
