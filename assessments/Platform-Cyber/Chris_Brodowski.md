**Rating**: 5 - Best in Class

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> While I am not the most comfortable in reviewing myself, I believe my teammates will speak to my work ethic, tencacity, ability to adapt and ability to fix problems.  Our team is extremely tightly-knit and our chemistry is everything.  I would pick no other group to learn and solve problems with.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Start doing: Need to catch up on my CISSP and Product Manager training, I am a bit behind.  Need to make time to take on my AI tasks, get back to using Claude more consistently like I used to.  I use AI on a daily basis but primarily Google Gemini, and from experience Claude is superior.
- Stop doing: I went a little too deep into the proverbial SonarQube rabbit hole, and I probably should have pulled out of it a bit earlier.  Having grit is great, and it's arguably my best attribute, but your grit has to be applied in maximum efficiency toward shipping outcomes for said grit to be worthwhile.  Have learned my lesson and have an example; I just reached a point when STIG'ing the Dependency Check container is pretty much at its end.  I could go further, but the bulk of the remaining vulnerabilities are at the kernel/host level and it doesn't make sense to invest further time until the host cluster itself is hardened, so I'm going to put in a merge request for now and move on.   
- Keep doing: Keep being gritty, keep working well with others, keep pairing, keep communicating, keep learning, keep improving myself and keep shipping outcomes.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Built our team's full suite of both SAST (SonarQube) and DAST (OWASP Zap) on the FORGE SecRel pipeline from start to finish.  This includes: 1) developing, testing and implementing source code on our CLI; 2) building, provisioning and hardening for security each of the Docker containers; and 3) Writing the Helm charts and Kubernetes manifests to deploy the contents onto OpenShift.  Along the way, I built from source, with no support from the vendor, a much more secure version of SonarQube than the vendors themselves have ever released.
-  Answered the call numerous times to operate outside of my comfort zone for both personal growth and for the benefit of the company.  I took on Product Manager duties (running our daily standups), I took on Client Liason duties (serving as assistant to Brittany Sailors with NIPR/SIPR outreach and scheduling until I was asked to stand by), I offered my services as an platform interview consultant and I was one of the first at Rise8 to push Mike Gehard's ClaudeAI devcontainers to their potential (and unintentionally costing more compute dollars than anyone else in that initial demonstration!)
- I have worked on maintaining SecRel's deployment of Nucleus Security.  I have generated a detailed set of documentation on both procedures and recommendations for implementing Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) in Nucleus Security and implemented that into our pipeline, which included submitting the documentation to FORGE Cyber and receiving a favorable review.  Nucleus Security will be the primary methodology for mitigating/enforcing vulnerabilities for the FORGE program and I have gleaned significant experience in it.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Chris began performing almost immediately after he was hired. He goes straight for the hard things that have to be done and does not stop until he conquers them. He's a joy to pair with and a boon to our team. Only issue is that there are times he should probably stop what he's doing to re-evaluate if it is worth continuing. If there's a particularly thorny issue that you expend every last ounce of brain power you have over 2 weeks, but it wasn't worth that kind of effort, or the team needs to review if we need to be doing something different, stopping and checking in might benefit him and the team as a whole.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Keep doing fantastic work! Chris's tenacity is his best feature
- Start deliberately pairing more. Chris needs to prevent his own burnout by leveraging pairing more effectively
- Start documenting / communicating more. Chris can multiply the impact of his efforts by presenting them to the team more or documenting it so all that knowledge becomes widely shared.

Chris is a very strong performer despite having many life challenges this year. He's work is always of very high quality and delivered on time.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Learning and delivering on AI as this has been identified as a company priority. 




Stop: Trying to over explain everything. You have gotten a lot better and realize that this is a personality characteristic that makes you enjoyable to work with, but remember to just dial it up or down as needed. 




Keep Doing: Working your way to becoming a team anchor or team lead. I really believe you would do great, especially with all the volunteering you do for hosting standup. I understand this may not happen until your personal life doesn't stay as crazy as right now.

**Comment**:
> Chris, your contributions to Team CyberSecRel represent some of the most complex technical problems we have faced. Your work on Nucleus integration, SonarQube hardening, and OWASP ZAP implementation has improved security posture while reducing time-to-release and time-to-onboard. These are technical wins that are force multipliers because they enable other teams to deliver value faster.




What stands out most is your ability to persist through frustrating technical challenges. When you tackled the Nucleus API integration or rebuilt SonarQube multiple times, you brought humor and maintained team morale throughout. That combination of technical grit and positive energy is rare and valuable.




I also appreciate how you extend grace and support to teammates during their learning journeys. You create space for others to experiment and make mistakes, which builds psychological safety for the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start:** allowing yourself to make more mistakes in the learning journey. You're already excellent at this with teammates, so please extend that same grace to yourself. Experimentation means some paths won't work out, and that's valuable data, not failure.
- **Stop:** dismissing incremental progress because you haven't reached the final goal yet. Each step forward is a win worth acknowledging, whether it's understanding a new API endpoint, getting one format working, or eliminating one possible solution. These small victories compound into the major achievements your peers recognize you for.
- **Keep:** persisting through frustrating technical challenges while maintaining your sense of humor. Your ability to stay the course when technology fights back is a strength. Your combination of determination and levity during standups keeps the team energized even during difficult sprints.
