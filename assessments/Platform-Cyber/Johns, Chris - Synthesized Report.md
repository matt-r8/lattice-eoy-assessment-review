## Accomplishments Review (Self-Assessment Question 13)

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with accomplishments text]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. Accelerating Core Platform Design with a Terraform POC
Accomplishment: During the initial Bifrost design, I leveraged my knowledge of Claude code and rapidly developed a Proof of Concept (POC) in under four hours using Terraform. This POC demonstrated the feasibility of using AWS Cognito, ECR, and IAM policies for secure customer onboarding and access control.








Mission Impact: This initiative did two things: first, it immediately validated and established the foundational security design for the Bifrost platform, minimizing design debate and risk. Second, it served as the team’s introduction and practical training to Terraform, elevating the team's infrastructure-as-code capabilities and accelerating future platform development. The POC ultimately became the production architecture.








2. Maintaining Development Velocity During Critical Platform Blockages
Accomplishment: When the challenging deployment of GitLab in the Palantir Apollo environment blocked the development team, I took the initiative to rapidly provision a test EC2 instance of GitLab and a GitLab runner using Rise8's existing AWS resources, Terraform, and Claude code.








Mission Impact: This action eliminated a critical bottleneck that had stalled multiple development stories, enabling engineers to continue development immediately. This prevented a significant loss of velocity and ensured continuous progress toward mission deliverables while the Platform team resolved the long-term Apollo deployment challenges.








3. Building a Safe, Realistic Training and Testing Environment
Accomplishment: I created a dedicated demo section in our team’s GitLab repository featuring a test Helm deployment that accurately mirrored our production environment, allowing the team to run it locally in a Minikube environment. I later tailored this environment for focused training.








Mission Impact: This provided the entire team with an accessible, safe environment for testing and debugging their deployments without risking production or staging systems, improving code quality and confidence. Most notably, it served as an invaluable training tool for our skill bridger, enabling him to quickly build practical, hands-on experience and confidence with Kubernetes and Helm, accelerating his readiness to contribute to the Rise8 mission.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Kenny Slater:**
Chris loves what he does and I believe because he loves what he does, he excels in his work. He constantly is tinkering which leads to learning. He is the 10,000 rep person. I believe if Chris gets assigned a task, that task will be done. I love that I am on a team with Chris.

**Dan Sanker:**
Despite being a relatively recent addition, Chris has made an immediate and positive impact. I've been consistently impressed by his combination of technical skill and personal drive. He clearly loves what he does and, as a result, does it exceptionally well.
His growth mindset and ability to maintain a positive, progress-oriented attitude—even in difficult circumstances—are a huge asset to our team's culture and resilience.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Chris has consistently stepped up to resolve issues for the Bifrost team.  When we first realized we couldn't use Gitlab in the IL5 environment, there was some reluctance to shift over to our corporate environment, but he just made it happen and unblocked the team.  That move set us up for several months of productive work while the issues with Gitlab kept unspooling.

**Jeremy Viray:**
Chris is a strong, dependable engineer who delivers results. When a technical problem arises, he’s immediately in problem-solving mode, relentlessly exploring options and working through complexity until he gets to a solid answer. His drive and commitment make him a key contributor on any project!

**Delaney Coveno:**
Chris loves his work and is always excited to dive into a task. His enthusiasm allows him to solve difficult problems. His affable nature makes him easy to work with. When pairing, he strikes a good balance of pulling from his past experience, doing new research, and listening to his colleague's ideas. I would value hearing his thoughts more often in team architectural discussions.

**Erica Chang:**
Chris has been an incredibly important member of the Bifrost team. He takes on some of the hardest/most cumbersome tasks with a positive attitude and no complaints. He tackled reinstalling Gitlab, and even when there was a massive problem and required more work, he approached it with the grit to get it done. He also completed the documentation of this reinstall, in order to ensure that the rest of the team is set up for success/won't be down for long should another Gitlab issue occur again in the future. These approaches allow the team to keep progressing forward and we wouldn't be able to without Chris

**Bryce Nguonly:**
I think I am most impressed with Chris' skill to pick up new technologies and initiatives by Rise8. You really jumped head first into the AI initiative, using Claude during this project and I feel like you have surpassed others (including me) in terms of prompting and usage of the tool. 




One initiative that jumped out at me was when the team was stuck on not having a gitlab instance, you really saved us by standing up a local AWS instance for us, which opened up a whole other track of work when we really needed it. You carved out your own time/work, to make a greater impact for the team.

**Clark Pain:**
Chris has been an absolute asset on the team!

**Steven Souto:**
Chris is a very solid and knowledgeable contributor to the Bifrost team. As stated himself, he excels when being handed interesting problems or tasks that require time and energy to unpack, discover, and implement. Very good at finding various solutions to problems and communicate the pros and cons of these solutions. However, I would like to see Chris put more effort into offering a opinion as a technical leader as to how something should move forward and more clearly take the reigns to drive an effort to completion. I think more involvement in the product process of story writing, pre-ipm would allow Chris to make sure that things left in an non-ideal state continue to move towards the ideal state. Chris himself has stated a disinterest in engaging with people external to the team which in turn creates less opportunity for him to engage with discussion that prepare us for external engagement.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
I would enthusiastically rehire Chris because, even without working directly together, it’s clear he consistently contribute to the team’s success. His updates show steady progress, accountability, and attention to quality. He brings professionalism and positivity to his work, which helps strengthen overall team performance and collaboration.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Kenny Slater:**
Keep: Tinkering and learning. Being passionate about what you do. Loving your work so much that you lose time of the hours you've worked.




Start: Possibly start teaching all the great things you've self-taught but even this is a hard one because you already do. 




Stop: You're very self-critical and self-deprecating. Most of the time I believe it's humorous in nature, but I think you're a rockstar. Maybe the depreciation is what fuels you but I do believe you're a little hard on yourself. It never crosses the line though, and I do take it all as jokes.

**Jennifer Van Hove:**
Start: Speaking up as needed in client / partner calls as needed to provide clarity or drive alignment.  You have the vision; everyone can contribute to the conversations, especially if you think things are going off the rails! 




Continue: Effectively unblocking the team, contributing to the overall project vision, and sharing out Bifrost info and learnings to clients and within Rise8.

**Jeremy Viray:**
Keep up the solid determination, setting a good example for team on grit. I'd love to see you participate more on bigger picture conversations about architecture with the team, I know you have lots of valuable platform experience that any team can benefit from.

**Delaney Coveno:**
- Start: Chris has more platform experience than most of the team, and it would be valuable if he would more frequently share his thoughts from past experiences in group settings and architectural discussions, as well as during pairing.
- Stop: Sometimes Chris has a tendency to silo himself - make sure to pair and share context with the team.
- Continue: Being enthusiastic about the work, approachable, motivated, and easy to work with.

**Erica Chang:**
- **Keep** building on your security and compliance knowledge. Especially with Graham's departure, this is a gap you'll be able to fill with this knowledge, allowing us to build in compliance in our service earlier. 
- **Keep** sharing your learnings with others - there's a lot for folks to learn from your platform experience, so keep it up!

**Bryce Nguonly:**
Stop: 
- Making too many README-esque files. The codebase sometimes gets cluttered with different kinds of help/troubleshooting guides that claude made. To continue to make the repos more human readable, I think that it would go a long way to just have a singular consolidated trouble shooting guide. It also forces you to reevaluate your current guide to make sure its up to date. 




Continue: 
- share out your personal learnings with the team and speaking out when you want to clarify things. I think that your voice on the team is really impactful being one of the platform engineers with lots of GovTech experience. So when you learn something, it feels like the whole team is learning something all over again. Even when you repeat something that is already said, it makes us revisit the topic and really think if we explained/thought about it thoroughly. 




Start: 
- lead architecture discussions. Your intuition on the platform is really strong. It seems like you understand what processes are required to achieve an ATO from an engineering perspective. I think you can lead a discussion on how Bifrost should ideally work, and leading architecture discussions would help everyone else align on a vision.

**Clark Pain:**
Keep up the hard work and dedication, the whole team sees how much effort and time you're putting in. Your experience and skillset have been super valuable so keep that up! Keep looking for ways to expand your expertise whether it be in software development or more external-facing roles.

**Steven Souto:**
I would recommend Chris start to take a more present and active approach in the product process on the team. Pair with our PM on fleshing out epics, help write stories for IPM, facilitate an open-ended architectural discussion, help prepare for a stakeholder meeting. There is a tremendous amount of context when engaging in those spaces that in turn create more efficient and focused engineering efforts, and I would say that focus on the mission would be the primary thing for Chris to work on. Additionally, Chris could put more effort into giving intentional and timely feedback. Considering putting dedicated 1:1s on the calendar, sharing how pairing week after a session, etc.




Keep crushing those individual tasks and deep dives into complex subjects. I love your persistence in writing good ADRs for big discussion and quickly sharing them out. I also find pairing with you very easy and breezy, good communication and focus.

**Tiyyiba Zahid:**
**Keep:** Maintaining a dependable and positive presence within the team. Your consistent follow-through, progress updates, and constructive communication make a reliable teammate who supports the team’s forward momentum and shared goals.
