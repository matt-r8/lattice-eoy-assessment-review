<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

1. Strategic Alignment & Technical Planning - I played a key role in creating a consistent project plan across delivery teams, including the creation of the initial FORGE portfolio roadmap. I iterated closely with the Delivery Lead to generate a plan that all teams could get behind, developing architecture and technical strategy documents for all epics to ensure technical details were fully aligned with the project plan.
2. RMF - I reviewed and helped write implementation narratives for all 20 RMF SOPs and generated the body of evidence required for proving we do what we say we do. I also translated these requirements into a technical backlog to ensuring we meet and exceed security controls.
3. Foundational Facilitation & Artifact Creation - I took on a large portion of the initial documentation and facilitation required to start the program on the right foot. This included leading D&F activities, generating DDD artifacts, creating architecture diagrams, and defining RACI charts.

## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**David Croney:**
Steven is a clear leader in the field of platform development. He is the person that people on his portfolio team, the delivery teams and the client, come to for expertise and guidance on the best way forward. He is a subject matter expert in this domain who i feel we can all learn from. He is awesome to work with! My only suggestion for improvement would have been freeing up some of his time responding to the multiple requests and questions he fielded by thinking about some mechanisms of delegation/enablement that would help with him being spread thinly. As a portfolio colleague, I would have benefitted from spending more time with him crafting strategy together.

**Adam Gardner:**
no comments see question 12.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
**Overview: Why I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser** Bair is a cornerstone of the FORGE project and one of the most capable engineers I have ever worked with. He possesses the rare ability to seamlessly move between high-level technical strategy and deep-dive tactical execution, often rolling up his sleeves to unblock critical tasks the same day he defines the architecture. He consistently shows up with high integrity, doing what is right for the mission. Retaining Bair is a no-brainer; his skillset is critical to our success, and I would be resistant to losing him on the team.

**Jeremy Steinbeck:**
Bair is the GOAT and is the definition of an A+ Player. They consistently deliver transformative results that go beyond their specific assignment and often their swim lane. I have relied on him not just to execute, but to set strategic direction for our security posture and platform architecture. He has displayed immense Grit by persevering through difficult challenges.

**Asare Nkansah:**
I have loved just about every second of working with Bair; he is an incredible human and coworker. His mind is exceptionally sharp, particularly when it comes to understanding personalities and relating to people. This gives him a profound sense of empathy, and I have always felt truly heard and listened to by him, as has the rest of the team.
He has a brilliant mindset for strategy, an open mind to new ideas, and carries the immense weight of this program with remarkable grace and stride. Even though he isn't hands-on-keyboard often, he has not lost his technical sharpness. He manages our stakeholders masterfully, creating a sense of safety and trust that is essential for the program's success. He is a phenomenal leader.

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**

**STOP:**

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**David Croney:**
Start: thinking about how to spread your knowledge around the team in a sustainable way if possible. Thinking about ways to push back on/lead the client to the outcome first way of thinking, especially with examples from your deep experience. Provide fast and direct feedback when needed to delivery teams to keep them on the right track especially if you can see them moving in a direction that seems not optimal or too slow.
Stop: You can be direct and fast with you feedback if we worked together in future and I would value it. Don't feel you need to hold off on that for your team or delivery teams.
Keep: Being an excellent well of information that your colleagues and clients trust. The calm and positive attitude in the face of difficult situations. Spreading your knowledge and educating the client and internal teams on the most effective approach to the problems at hand.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
- **Start** prioritizing mentorship to multiply your impact across the portfolio. You are operating effectively at the portfolio level, but because of your high skill level, you often end up solving the hardest problems yourself. Your primary goal now is to invest in other engineers coaching them to solve problems the way you do. This ensures the portfolio's success is sustainable and not dependent solely on your individual bandwidth.
- **Start** providing clear, direct feedback as a tool for team growth. Your natural integrity and kindness are huge strengths, but sometimes they can unintentionally soften the message when expectations aren't being met. Remember that clarity is kindness. To help your team reach their full potential, challenge yourself to give feedback that is direct and unambiguous, so they know exactly where they stand and how to improve.
- **Consider** the long-term sustainability of jumping in to save the day. You are often the one unblocking the team, which everyone appreciates. However, if the portfolio relies on you personally to fix critical tasks, it creates a dependency. Consider using those "unblocking" moments as teaching opportunities instead, ensuring you are delivering team resilience.
- **Keep** bridging the gap between high-level strategy and tactical execution. This vertical capability, the ability to define the vision and then validate it in the code, is what gives you such high credibility. It is the foundation of your influence; never lose that connection to the ground truth.
- **Keep** modeling a mission-first integrity. Your willingness to do what is right for the mission, regardless of the difficulty, inspires trust. This is the intangible quality that makes everyone view you not just as a leader, but as a true partner in their success.

**Jeremy Steinbeck:**
For the next year, I recommend you start aggressively scaling your influence and impact across the FORGE Team and beyond.




1. Start Delegating: You must delegate more technical execution work to team members. This directly protects you from burnout and ensures you have the capacity required to fulfill the Best in Grade responsibility of setting strategic direction. 




2. Start Enabling A-Players: Focus on driving the performance and growth of your teammates. Treat complex problems as coaching opportunities to help them develop a Growth Mindset and elevate their output to consistently produce A Player work. 




3. Start Pressing the Envelope: Use the time gained from delegation to Be Bold by identifying and championing capabilities that lead to transformative results to our clients.
