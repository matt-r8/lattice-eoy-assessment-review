  "accomplishments": "The first accomplishment that I would like to highlight on is when the contract first started and things started to move it was hard to find traction in regards to what work needed to be done. I found myself seeking and offering help to not only Ann and the rest of the team. I would reach out to other teams on FORGE and express interest in what others were doing and providing help. \n\n\n\n\nThe second accomplishment that I would like to highlight is the willingness to step up during demos when other were not comfortable in doing so. I found it a way to challenge myself and my comfort zone and provide my teams accomplishments and contributions in shipping outcomes. \n\n\n\n\nThe third accomplishment I would like to highlight is when times got challenging with tasks such as creating ways of gathering metrics for ITS items. At the time of this task, Platform was quite bogged down with tons of work and did not want to bother them leading me to  struggle a bit in implementing a solution. Even with the struggles, I did not quit and found the answers to my questions, created a product and delivered the expected out come which was then presented in our bi weekly demo.",
  "enps_comments": "**Dave Blotter:**\nChase is a high-performing member of our team and a pleasure to work with. He has a fantastic \"can-do\" attitude and approaches every task with a genuine desire to learn and always seeks to deliver high-quality results. He asks questions when he does not understand and works hard to ensure that he delivers in accordance with expectations.\n\n\n\n\nHis ability to learn and apply new things with Gitlab pipeline development, Grafana metrics implementation, and helping to implement a disaster recovery plan for the project has been impressive; he has become a real asset to the team and project. He's proactive, asks intelligent questions, and is receptive to feedback. As his senior teammate, I've been incredibly impressed to see his confidence and competence grow, I have observed that his performance has exceeded what he was hired to do. He is a valuable contributor, and I'm excited to see what he does next.\n\n**Ann Kung:**\nYour work ethic and quick learning have significantly advanced the team's core deliverables, particularly with the service desk and metrics visualization. You take initiative to tackle technical challenges without explicit direction and demonstrate a strong bias for action. You consistently exhibit a growth mindset, proactively learning new technologies like Grafana and Python and seeking out solutions for the team.\n\n**Asare Nkansah:**\nI agree. Chase is a solid and valuable member of our team whom I enjoy working with. He consistently demonstrates great ambition and tenacity, and is always looking for opportunities to get involved and help push our team's goals forward. This proactive, team-player attitude is a significant asset.\n\n\n\n\nTo increase his impact and accelerate his growth, I believe the next step is for him to focus on bridging the experience gap with core technologies like Kubernetes/Openshift and AWS. By dedicating time to strengthening these fundamentals, he will be better equipped to tackle more complex technical challenges independently and become an even more versatile contributor. Would also start to pave a path for a bit more collaboration between IT & platform in a way that can make a difference.\n\n**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nChase eagerly jumped into his role and began delivering results. Coming from an on-prem background was not a roadblock to provide IT services in our environment, he took it upon himself to study and research cloud technology to do his job. A model \"A\" player that I'd be happy to work alongside of.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Dave Blotter:**\n- **START:** I would encourage Chase to **start** taking the lead on a small-scale project or a more complex area of our operations. He has the technical skills and the trust of the team, and I am confident he is ready to take that next step in ownership.\n- **STOP:** I would recommend you **stop** trying to do everything yourself. You're a reliable teammate, but as you grow, it's important to **stop** feeling like you have to say \"yes\" to every small task. It's okay to ask for help or clarification so you can stay focused on the bigger, more complex challenges. As you grow more senior, delegation is another important behavior to learn and apply.\n- **KEEP:** Please **keep** your incredible positive attitude and curiosity. Your eagerness to learn and tackle new challenges is a contagious example for others to see and emulate, it is a massive benefit to our team's culture and capability.\n\n**Ann Kung:**\n1. Keep Proactively Bridging Communication Gaps: You consistently step up to bridge communication and technical gaps across the portfolio. You've established relationships and work well with team members on other delivery teams. Keep it up!\n2. Look for opportunities to practice communicating the outcomes (the impact and whys) in addition to the technical process. This will help increase your skill in communicating strategic summaries to leadership or customers.\n3. Keep building on technical knowledge of the platform & devops: Your initiative to learn Python exhibits a strong growth mindset; keep that up and continue exploring other languages and tools essential to our platform. You are rapidly adapting to software development practices; continue to engage actively in these ceremonies to understand the *why* behind them and how they drive our mission.\n\n**Jeremy Steinbeck:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n\n**Pedro Torres:**\nContinue learning and growing. Keep working with the different teams to understand their environments and finding solutions to issues.\n",
