  "employee_name": "Dylan Bossie",
  "accomplishments": "1. Implemented FORGE authentication/authorization for OCP, RedHat IdM, and GitLab in fully automated, production-ready fashion via Helm, Terraform, and Ansible, accelerating implementation of RBAC and ACM alignment in DAFCW environment with the on-prem site to get us to IATT and ATO more rapidly as we achieve alignment with on-prem security officers and consistently implement accurate least-permissions RBAC.\n2. Implemented environment-wide FORGE SCAP scans for servers and OCP nodes including garbage collection, consolidated exports to a centralized environment (including establishing zero-trust communication) in fully automated, production-ready fashion via Ansible and Helm, providing automated, repeatable, production-ready security scans with a single command to deploy into any AWS account, accelerating time to delivery for our security officers of necessary scans to evaluate our environment, which is critical for IATT and ATO.\n3. Implemented full end-to-end automation of the FORGE PDH, from the Terraform to deploy the EC2 to the Ansible that installs and configures all dependencies needed for the PDH to deploy the rest of the environment. This rapidly accelerates deployment into the DAFCW environment, significantly reducing bootstrapping time for each account and shifting overall timelines left to IATT, ATO, and outcome delivery.",

Dylan never shy's away from an unknown tech stack or problem and always tackles whatever is necessary while bringing a solid teamwork culture. He is always one to be a proponent of pairing, and getting ahead of any knowledge silos on the team.\n\n**Brandon Shouse:**\n- Dylan really stepped up on this new contract, leading the way for several areas of the architecture, process, and practices for FORGE\n- Seeing some great quality work on several pieces of the FORGE platform\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\nOne of the best engineers I've had a chance to work with in my career.

His technical prowess is genuinely exceptional; he has continued to grow impressively during our time as teammates, and I believe his skills have elevated to be among the best in the entire company.\n\n\n\n\nThis has been especially clear in his recent work. He has been a master of bootstrapping critical efforts, taking the lead on preparing the PDH package and its automation, and wrangling all the necessary container images to get the job done. His ability to collaborate and his commitment to our mission are tremendous. He has a rare ability to spot needs across the FORGE program and is always willing to do what it takes to rise to the occasion.\n\n\n\n\nCrucially, his willingness to do the hard things extends to jumping into new, tricky technologies he doesn't fully understand; he doesn't hide from a challenge, he runs towards it. On a personal level, Dylan is a force multiplier for the team. His top-notch attitude and resilience give me more confidence just by working alongside him.

I learned so much from them and would be thrilled to be on their team again.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Eric Whitman:**\nKeep advocating for pairing and tackling new challenges. Keep speaking up when you identify issues in timelines for planning and also knowledge silos. As you are in a Sr role now, looks for opportunities for lines of work to own and also how to best communicate/KT these to the rest of the team.\n\n**Brandon Shouse:**\n- Keep the energy up! I know it is very frustrating in the government contracting world, but the dedication and drive are very noticeable\n- We all need to do this, but maybe a little more knowledge sharing and team architecture discussions where applicable, as you progress through levels/your career\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\nKeep up the good work you are doing technically and continue volunteering for demos, speaking up in meetings, etc.\n\n**Nick Luckey:**\nDylan should keep making us all laugh with his witty sense of humor.\n\n**Nick Weiss:**\nPlease **continue** to be such a powerful force for quality and clarity on this team. Your clear, direct feedback is invaluable, and your willingness to mentor and share your deep domain expertise actively helps others level up. I also deeply value your willingness to speak up in our IPMs and other meetings. Voicing your perspective and potential concerns about long-term decisions is critical\u2014it consistently helps us spot risks, adjust our plans, and make more robust choices.\n\n\n\n\nAs you move forward, I'd love for you to **start** looking for ways to scale this influence even further. Perhaps to scale your mentorship, consider championing a \"learning session\" or creating a durable piece of documentation on a core area you specialize in. This would help extend your positive impact beyond your direct interactions.\n",
