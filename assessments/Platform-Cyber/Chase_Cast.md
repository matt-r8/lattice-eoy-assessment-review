**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> For the next year I plan to improve upon #'s 7, 4, and 1 to advance to the Best in Class category to refine myself into a even better A player.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> The first accomplishment that I would like to highlight on is when the contract first started and things started to move it was hard to find traction in regards to what work needed to be done. I found myself seeking and offering help to not only Ann and the rest of the team. I would reach out to other teams on FORGE and express interest in what others were doing and providing help. 




The second accomplishment that I would like to highlight is the willingness to step up during demos when other were not comfortable in doing so. I found it a way to challenge myself and my comfort zone and provide my teams accomplishments and contributions in shipping outcomes. 




The third accomplishment I would like to highlight is when times got challenging with tasks such as creating ways of gathering metrics for ITS items. At the time of this task, Platform was quite bogged down with tons of work and did not want to bother them leading me to  struggle a bit in implementing a solution. Even with the struggles, I did not quit and found the answers to my questions, created a product and delivered the expected out come which was then presented in our bi weekly demo.

**Comment**:
> Chase is a high-performing member of our team and a pleasure to work with. He has a fantastic "can-do" attitude and approaches every task with a genuine desire to learn and always seeks to deliver high-quality results. He asks questions when he does not understand and works hard to ensure that he delivers in accordance with expectations.




His ability to learn and apply new things with Gitlab pipeline development, Grafana metrics implementation, and helping to implement a disaster recovery plan for the project has been impressive; he has become a real asset to the team and project. He's proactive, asks intelligent questions, and is receptive to feedback. As his senior teammate, I've been incredibly impressed to see his confidence and competence grow, I have observed that his performance has exceeded what he was hired to do. He is a valuable contributor, and I'm excited to see what he does next.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **START:** I would encourage Chase to **start** taking the lead on a small-scale project or a more complex area of our operations. He has the technical skills and the trust of the team, and I am confident he is ready to take that next step in ownership.
- **STOP:** I would recommend you **stop** trying to do everything yourself. You're a reliable teammate, but as you grow, it's important to **stop** feeling like you have to say "yes" to every small task. It's okay to ask for help or clarification so you can stay focused on the bigger, more complex challenges. As you grow more senior, delegation is another important behavior to learn and apply.
- **KEEP:** Please **keep** your incredible positive attitude and curiosity. Your eagerness to learn and tackle new challenges is a contagious example for others to see and emulate, it is a massive benefit to our team's culture and capability.

**Comment**:
> Your work ethic and quick learning have significantly advanced the team's core deliverables, particularly with the service desk and metrics visualization. You take initiative to tackle technical challenges without explicit direction and demonstrate a strong bias for action. You consistently exhibit a growth mindset, proactively learning new technologies like Grafana and Python and seeking out solutions for the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Keep Proactively Bridging Communication Gaps: You consistently step up to bridge communication and technical gaps across the portfolio. You've established relationships and work well with team members on other delivery teams. Keep it up!
2. Look for opportunities to practice communicating the outcomes (the impact and whys) in addition to the technical process. This will help increase your skill in communicating strategic summaries to leadership or customers.
3. Keep building on technical knowledge of the platform & devops: Your initiative to learn Python exhibits a strong growth mindset; keep that up and continue exploring other languages and tools essential to our platform. You are rapidly adapting to software development practices; continue to engage actively in these ceremonies to understand the *why* behind them and how they drive our mission.

**Comment**:
> I agree. Chase is a solid and valuable member of our team whom I enjoy working with. He consistently demonstrates great ambition and tenacity, and is always looking for opportunities to get involved and help push our team's goals forward. This proactive, team-player attitude is a significant asset.




To increase his impact and accelerate his growth, I believe the next step is for him to focus on bridging the experience gap with core technologies like Kubernetes/Openshift and AWS. By dedicating time to strengthening these fundamentals, he will be better equipped to tackle more complex technical challenges independently and become an even more versatile contributor. Would also start to pave a path for a bit more collaboration between IT & platform in a way that can make a difference.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **Keep Doing**
- **Keep bringing that ambition and tenacity to the team.** Your drive to get involved and your willingness to dive headfirst into technically unfamiliar tasks are huge strengths. Please continue to be proactive and eager to help the team move forward.
#### **Start Doing**
- **Start dedicating focused time to building foundational skills in Kubernetes and AWS.** This is the single most important area for your growth. I recommend actively seeking out hands-on learning opportunities, whether through tutorials, labs, or by pairing with other team members on related tasks. Building this expertise will unlock your ability to contribute on a deeper technical level.
#### **Stop Doing**
- **Stop lacking strategy about how you initiate collaboration.** Before pulling others into a discussion, take a moment to define the core problem and identify what specific input you need. This will help you pinpoint the *right person/group/people* to engage and allow you to approach them with a clear, concise question, making the collaboration more effective and respectful of everyone's time. I really love and appreciate the drive to collaborate, I think it's just figuring out how to seek advice so you can be intentional about doing it in the most effective way possible - especially since time is so valuable on this project.
