**Kyle Dozier:**
Hafeez and I have worked side-by-side for over half a year now on the VA contract, weathering the storm together. I still haven't had many opportunities to pair, due to both of us trying to stay focused on our own work and help out the other engineers, but I have continued to appreciate his unwavering and consistent contributions to the team. He has repeatedly reached out for feedback, and clearly take an action and improved on that feedback. I've seen him grow to be more outspoken in meetings, speaking his mind, even when it's uncomfortable. His insights and feedback are always appreciated.

**Noah McHugh:**
A great year of growth for you, can't wait to see what you do next year.
