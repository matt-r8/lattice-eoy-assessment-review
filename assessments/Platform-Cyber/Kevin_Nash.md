### Question 10
**No Unnecessary Rules: I am very comfortable in a high agency environment, and don’t seek or try to implement unnecessary rules.**

**Rating**: 4 - Team Leader

### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I consistently take ownership of complex, undefined problems and bring structure, clarity, and measurable outcomes to them.  When the stakeholder introduces new or ambiguous requests, I break them down into actionable steps, validate assumptions, and deliver something that adds value - even when the path isn't initially clear.  




I've created data-driven reporting that help Watchtower shift from reactive to proactive observability.  My focus is on doing the work that matters, making it reproducible for others, and leaving things clearer and cleaner than I found them.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Expanding automation around Datadog and report generation to include monitor metadata, trend detection, and AI-driven summaries.  Identify how the work we do ties to organizational impact.  Collaborating more with other teams both at VA and at Rise8.




I would like to stop over-iterating before sharing progress.  I believe quick feedback is more important than trying to deliver a completed product.




I plan to continue producing reliable, high-quality outputs that demonstrate Watchtower's value, seek patterns and connections that help make informed decisions, remain open to feedback and constructive criticism, follow through on commitments that move the team forward.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Developed a monitor snapshot, comparison and restore toolkit enabling safe, automated visibility into monitor changes across the VA ecosystem.  It introduced timestamped snapshots, diff-based change tracking, deleted monitor recovery, and dashboard generation for both triage and error tracking giving Watchtower full traceability and data integrity for all Datadog monitors, preventing loss of critical configurations and laying the groundwork for reliable repeatable observability analytics across VA systems.  




Developed the Datadog Alert Summary Reporter, a system used to generate weekly, monthly, and lifetime enhanced reports for leadership.  It transforms raw Datadog event data into structured, priority-aware markdown reports, automatically categorizing monitors by team, service, and behavior (expected/transient/defect).  The system made recurring alert patterns, flappiness, and ownership measurable shifting Watchtower from reactive alert review to proactive reliability analysis.  




Developed a triage report generator, automating daily Watch workflows.  It creates ready-to-use triage reports with monitor context, Slack messaging templates, and issue linking for recurring alerts.  This helps teams resolve issues faster and streamlines communications allowing those on the Watch the ability to focus on other tasks.
