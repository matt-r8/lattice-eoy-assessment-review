  "accomplishments": "1. Led the Zscaler CNAP POC, design, and enablement effort\u2014establishing the IL5-approved zero-trust egress/ingress model for the entire platform. Later on took ownership of other CNAP components (NGFW, tf automation)\n   1. took full ownership of the Zscaler Cloud Native Application Protection (CNAP) implementation for IL5\u2014including the initial proof-of-concept, AWS GovCloud integration, TGW + GWLB service insertion, role/IAM scoping, app connector connection, spoke-account route automation requirements, and the creation of clear, repeatable documentation and KT material for engineering and security teams.\n   2. Eliminated major blockers around IL5 egress control by defining least-privilege CNAP roles for transit + spoke accounts, ensuring compliance with SC-7, AC-4, and boundary-protection mandates\n2. Secured GCP Partnership Accreditation (Service Partner + Government Sector Subcontractor), Unlocking New Revenue Paths, $6K Credits, and Marketing Opportunities\n   1. Achieved formal GCP partnership recognition, enabling the company to deliver Google Cloud consulting, modernization, and platform engineering services across both commercial and federal programs.\n   2. Completed all government-sector subcontractor onboarding steps (including GCP Professional certification) allowing us to participate in public-sector GCP opportunities\u2014a key strategic expansion area.\n   3. Secured $6,000 in GCP billing credits, giving our engineering teams the ability to prototype, train, and test workloads at zero cost, accelerating internal capability development.\n   4. Partnered with Marketing leadership to establish co-marketing alignment with Google (opened doors for Marketing Funds requests, as well as potential funding for the summit which is WIP)\n3. Drove Engineering Hiring Quality and Scalability by Serving as a Primary Interviewer and Training New Interviewers\n   1. I have been one of the most consistent and reliable engineers participating in the technical interview pipeline, regularly conducting candidate evaluations and actively training additional engineers to become confident, calibrated interviewers. I am the only platform engineer who is still actively interviewing (both for external candidates and internal promotions) from years ago when we made our first pass at a technical assessment, because I believe it is one of the most important factors in reaching our growth goals and scalability for our BHAG.",
  "enps_comments": "**Dylan Bossie:**\nEric is a great, solid performer on the team and gets things done, including hard tasks that nobody knows how to do yet (zScaler, for example)\n\n**Asare Nkansah:**\nEric is one of the best teammates I've had, not just on this contract but in my entire time at the company. He is the very definition of a team player, consistently willing to do the \"dirty work\"\u2014whatever the team needs to succeed\u2014without a second thought. I am beyond grateful to have him on the team.\n\n\n\n\nHis technical skills are ridiculously strong, honed by the wide range of challenges he tackles for both our team and the company as a whole. He's a highly creative problem-solver who is always jumping into the next challenge. This technical excellence is matched by his collaborative spirit; he's super fun to pair with and brings a kind, light presence to the team that makes everyone around him better.\n\n\n\n\nHis positive attitude and willingness to do what it takes make him an invaluable asset. He is a core part of our success.\n\n**Brandon Shouse:**\n- Excellent work so far on FORGE, especially with the licensing and working through ZScaler\n- Always willing to reach out to support/tech contacts to get things moving\n\n**Adam Gardner:**\nn/a see question below.\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\nOne of the best engineers I've had a chance to work with! Super smart and very helpful.\n\n**Nick Luckey:**\nI find working with Eric to be an extremely valuable and positive experience.\n\n\n\n\nHe stands out for his exceptional reliability. When Eric takes on a task\u2014particularly the most complex and challenging assignments\u2014I have absolute confidence that it will be handled effectively and seen through to completion. He is incredibly persistent, refusing to back down from a tough problem until he delivers a robust solution.\n\n\n\n\nEric is an excellent team member whose contributions are consistently high quality. His peers and I deeply value his steady, dependable presence, and his ability to successfully manage complicated issues ensures our major deliverables remain on track and meet the highest possible standards.\n\n**Nick Weiss:**\nEric is the definition of a true team player and a pleasure to work with. They not only excelled in their own role but also consistently elevated the work of those around them. I would be thrilled to have them as a teammate again and wholeheartedly recommend them. I always appreciate Eric's willingness to lend a hand wherever needed (even the less exciting tasks/meetings), and willingness to help others.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Dylan Bossie:**\nStart: \n- Helping out more with troubleshooting issues, outages, etc.\n- Documenting work/knowledge sharing\n\n\n\n\nStop: \n- Idk\n\n\n\n\nContinue:\n- Being involved with pairing\n- Directing technical decisions and cautioning when things don't make sense\n- Tackling difficult tasks and seeing them through\n\n**Brandon Shouse:**\n- Keep that energy/drive going!\n- At your level, a little more senior-level documentation and diagramming would be extremely useful for projects and your teams. i.e., ZScaler really needs to be well documented/diagramming, or similar solutions in the future, thinking fully through the implementation and all the moving parts, coordinating with the team\n\n**Adam Gardner:**\n**Keep:**\n- Please keep being the proactive professional that you are. Even though we work on different aspects of the project, I consistently see you helping others remove uncertainty from their tasks. Your deep knowledge of GovTech and security makes you an invaluable resource, and I frequently send people your way because I know you\u2019ll have the answer.\n**Stop:**\n- Stop keeping a low profile! You have the technical chops and the professional reputation to be a louder voice in the room, you have the credibility to lead from the front.\n**Start:**\n- I would like to see you start taking ownership of the \"bigger picture.\" This means leading monthly updates and translating your technical engineering tasks into long-term roadmaps. You have the expertise\u2014now is the time to start showing the wider group *how* you think by sharing your documentation and strategy publicly.\n\n**Jerod Culpepper:**\nKeep - Stepping up and doing hard tasks. I think you also do a great job of calling out stuff when you see it.\n\n**Nick Luckey:**\nEric should keep being the dependable point person for the most challenging and complex tasks**.** His ability to handle the toughest assignments and deliver reliable results is critical to the team's success and confidence in its deliverables.\n\n**Nick Weiss:**\nPlease **continue** being such a reliable and proactive pillar for this team. Your willingness to volunteer for any task, big or small, and to step up and lead meetings when needed is incredibly valuable. We also deeply appreciate your collaborative spirit\u2014you're always ready to help teammates, provide insightful ideas, and apply your problem-solving skills to any challenge that comes your way.\n\n\n\n\n**Start:** You often volunteer for tasks or to run meetings as needed and that's hugely appreciated but it's clear you have the ability to lead and own. Perhaps you could start owning more of the planning, delegation, unblocking others, and presentation planning. This would be a great way to formally channel all your strengths into a larger, high-impact area.\n",
