**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Over the past year, I’ve consistently demonstrated strong ownership, initiative, and a proactive drive to elevate both cybersecurity and GRC practices at Rise8. I’ve stepped into complex, ambiguous spaces, often without precedent, documentation, or established workflows and built clarity, structure, and forward momentum. 




Whether guiding the USPTO cATO implementation, shaping technical security practices, supporting product teams, or independently driving internal enablement, I have consistently delivered above expectations while operating at a level beyond my formal role.




I bring a rare blend of hands-on technical execution, deep RMF/cATO expertise, product-minded problem solving, and the ability to translate complex concepts into clear guidance for developers, analysts, stakeholders, and leadership. I’ve become a go-to resource for cATO, compliance automation, and modern GRC, trusted to represent Rise8 with clients and internal teams. My work has directly strengthened our ability to support ongoing authorization, pipeline-driven security, and the modernization of government cybersecurity practices, all of which advance Rise8’s mission of delivering better software, faster, and more securely.




I consistently show up with a growth mindset, integrity, and a commitment to raising the bar for how compliance and security are executed across our engagements.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **Start**
• Deepening my technical GRC skillset in areas like vulnerability scanning, vulnerability management, automation of controls, and integrating BOE artifacts directly into CI/CD pipelines.
• Formalizing Rise8’s approach to Policy-as-Code and Compliance-as-Code by contributing playbook updates, internal training, enforceable control mappings, and real-world labs to raise maturity across the organization.
• Expanding cross-team enablement by building resources, templates, and educational content that help analysts, engineers, and PMs understand security, compliance, and cATO in practical terms.
• Stepping more intentionally into a Staff-level role by shaping direction, mentoring others, and bridging strategy with execution on complex cybersecurity programs.
### 
**Stop**
• Overextending myself into areas outside my scope that don’t move the mission forward or don’t receive organizational support.
• Taking on operational noise that detracts from strategic work, deep technical execution, and high-impact deliverables.
• Downplaying my expertise in cATO, RMF, and modern GRC engineering. I plan to advocate more clearly for what I know and the direction I believe is best for the mission and our clients.
### 
**Keep**
• Operating with strong ownership and initiative, especially in ambiguous or high-stakes spaces.
• Delivering high-quality guidance and documentation that brings clarity to complex cybersecurity problems.
• Helping Rise8 lead the government in modern GRC and ongoing authorization, and continuing to be a trusted voice in cATO implementation.
• Collaborating with cross-functional teams and turning vision into structured, executable plans that move engagements forward.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **1. Leading and advancing cATO implementation at USPTO**
I played a pivotal role in shaping the early implementation of cATO at USPTO, from mapping controls into the SecRel pipeline, analyzing gaps, helping build the path to production, and defining the technical and compliance workflows needed for ongoing authorization.
**Impact:** This work establishes Rise8 as the thought leader in cATO, strengthens our reputation as the only vendor capable of delivering true continuous authorization, and positions the client to ship software faster and more securely, fully aligned with Rise8’s mission.




### **2. Building and modernizing Rise8’s internal GRC and policy practices**
I significantly contributed to internal cybersecurity modernization by writing updated cATO documentation, creating RMF guidance, mapping enforceable controls to real tools, and helping define how Policy-as-Code and Compliance-as-Code fit into the pipeline. I also built training content, diagrams, and processes that are now used across teams.
**Impact:** This has accelerated Rise8’s shift toward a modern, automated security practice, reduced compliance friction, improved team alignment, and strengthened our ability to meet client needs while maintaining speed and quality.




### **3. Enabling cross-team success through documentation, education, and technical clarity**
I consistently stepped up to mentor, clarify, and educate across teams, whether through deep-dive explanations of RMF, cATO, CI/CD controls, vulnerability management, or government security processes. I’ve created resources, diagrams, and guidance that eliminated ambiguity and helped engineers, PMs, and analysts work more confidently and efficiently.
**Impact:** This improved team velocity, reduced rework, strengthened security outcomes, and created a culture where compliance and engineering work together instead of in silos, directly contributing to Rise8’s ability to deliver faster, safer, high-quality software.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Ash, your willingness to step up and support the Cyber team during extended absences is a testament to your commitment to mission success. You dove in and applied your knowledge of the Risk Management Framework to unblock critical work. Your ability to operate effectively in ambiguity has kept momentum going when it could have stalled. This combination of technical expertise, persistence, and team-first mentality makes you an invaluable team member.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start:** experimenting with more curiosity-driven approaches to de-risking your work. When you hit what seems like a blocker, challenge whether it's a constraint or just the current framing of the problem. Try smaller experiments to test assumptions earlier because sometimes the obstacle is in how we're thinking about the problem, not in the circumstances themselves. This will amplify your already strong problem-solving skills.
- **Stop:** buying into self-limiting beliefs. You've already proven you can master new domains like Policy-as-Code, lead organization-wide initiatives, and establish new practices at Rise8. Trust your capabilities and the evidence of your impact.
- **Keep:** applying your deep understanding of RMF to tackle ambiguous problems. Your ability to receive a complex challenge, brainstorm multiple approaches, and then start making progress without perfect information is a valuable strength. Keep building on the groundbreaking work you've done with Policy-as-Code, Compliance-as-Code, and the GRC practice.

> Ashley’s been killing it this year. She built the GRC playground and kicked off the RMF practice group, which have both made a huge difference for the team. She’s always sharing knowledge around RMF and cATO, breaking things down in a way that actually helps everyone level up. On calls and standups, her technical insight and attention to detail always shine through. Ashley really sets the standard for what it means to be an A Player and represents Rise8 in the best way possible.

**Comment**:
> Keep doing everything you’re doing, you’ve clearly outgrown the expectations of your current role and are already operating at a Staff level. The GRC playground, RMF practice group, and the way you consistently share knowledge have had a huge impact on both the team and the mission. You lead by example, bring a ton of expertise to every conversation, and raise the bar for everyone around you. I’d love to see you continue leaning into that leadership space and owning more strategic initiatives since you’ve more than proven you’re ready for that next step.

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> KEEP DOING:
✓ Methodical approach to testing and validation - your discipline ensures quality and catches issues early
✓ Collaborative partnership with teammates on security controls - this pairing is highly effective
✓ Setting healthy work-life boundaries - your transparency about hours and availability is excellent modeling for the team
✓ Clear communication about availability and workload - this helps the team plan effectively and respects your time




START DOING:
