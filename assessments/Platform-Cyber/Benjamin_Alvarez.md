**Comment**:
> While Ben has a solid foundational skill set and a willingness to learn the primary concern is the gap between effort and delivered outcomes. To be an A Player, results must be consistent. Currently, execution and communication gaps frequently introduce unnecessary risk and impact our team's ability to demonstrate Outcomes in Production. Ben needs to take greater ownership of the full cycle of work, from acceptance through to communicating the final impact.

Additionally, maintaining your consistent "Always Be Kind" approach in all interactions is crucial for fostering a healthy team environment.Continue to explore innovative, non-traditional approaches for leveraging AI and technology in our cybersecurity practice.You must adopt a more proactive approach to communication, particularly with challenging and unresponsive customers. Furthermore, I expect you to take on additional initiatives and broaden your involvement in other areas of the company.For the next year, I'd like to see you start proactively owning the full lifecycle of your work.Focus Areas for Enhanced Performance:Proactive Risk Communication (Keep it Real): Communicate potential risks and necessary pivots upward and outward early on, before they escalate into problems.Complete the Feedback Loop: Consistently finalize deliverables by communicating the final outcome and its overall impact to both the team and the customer.Prioritize Impact Over Activity (Doing What is Required): Rigorously connect daily activities to measurable outputs and desired outcomes to ensure efforts are driving real impact, thereby closing the gap between busyness and effectiveness.

**Comment**:
> Ben’s been crushing it as an ISSE on the cyber team showing up strong and putting his technical skills to work to get the FORGE cyber environment fully dialed in. He’s always willing to jump in, troubleshoot, and share knowledge to help others get unstuck. His willingness to mentor and support anyone who asks really stands out, and it’s clear he takes pride in elevating the whole team, not just his own work. Ben brings the right mix of technical depth, initiative, and teamwork exactly what you want in a senior engineer.
