### Synthesized Summary

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Dylan Bossie:**
Asare provides strong leadership for the team via his excellent communication skills, high-level prioritization, and high motivation. He's also strong technically and generally produces good work.




Where he could improve as a leader would be to focus more on advocating for the team up front with reasonable deadlines, and giving a stronger emphasis for the team in producing quality work vs. producing fast work (e.g. well-documented, automated, production-ready code)

**Brandon Shouse:**
- You bring a lot to Rise 8 and the FORGE project. Keep it up. Being willing to go on-site and work with our clients is huge.
- Overall, a great asset to Rise 8 and your teams

**Jerod Culpepper:**
One of the best people I've had a chance to work with in my career.

**Nick Luckey:**
I genuinely enjoy every opportunity to work alongside Asare.




He is an exceptional team member who consistently operates at a level that far exceeds expectations, always going above and beyond the stated requirements of any task. His dedication to outstanding quality sets a superb standard for the entire group.




Asare serves as a leader and example for the rest of the team. Team members frequently look to him for guidance, not just because of the caliber of his output, but also because he is such a kind and fun person to work with. He contributes significantly to maintaining a positive, engaging, and highly effective team environment.

**Eric Whitman:**
Asare is a true A-Player and I am glad he is our Tech Anchor on the platform team. He is great at interacting with the customer and other teams and also has a great talent for organizing the team around planning and architectural decisions. He is the glue for the team and is never afraid to speak up about technical implementations or when he sees us going down a wrong path. There have been some tough moments in the FORGE contract and I'm glad he was able to step into the role and has had a huge impact on the team.

**Steven Bair:**
Asare is hands-down one of the best platform engineers I have had the opportunity to work with. He combines strong technical skills with an adaptability that is crucial for our project. He consistently strives to Do the Right Thing the first time, asking the right questions to ensure precision and quality.
Culturally, Asare exemplifies Keep It Real. He possesses a relentlessly positive mindset but balances it with the courage to be bold—he is never afraid to ask the hard questions or call it out when he feels we are heading down a challenging path. This year, he successfully stepped into a Team Lead/Anchor role, where he demonstrated great versatility by helping his PM develop project plans and user stories, while effectively leading high-level conversations with other delivery leads and external stakeholders.

**Nick Weiss:**
Asare is the total package: a remarkably strong technical mind, a proactive and empathetic leader, and an excellent communicator. He is a true pillar who builds and cultivates trust with everyone he interacts with. He's always doing the right thing, and I would not just enthusiastically rehire him, I would build a team around him.

**STOP:**

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Dylan Bossie:**
Start:
- Implementing work quality standards and review processes for the team
   - Peer review processes
   - Code promotion processes
   - Documentation requirements




Stop:
- Accepting portfolio asks/demands on deadlines etc. without consulting the team




Continue:
- Setting the example for the team for motivation and responsibility
- Protecting the team from low priority asks and low value meetings
- Being receptive to feedback and open to discussion/debate on technical decisions
- Treating everyone with respect, grace, and optimism

**Brandon Shouse:**
- Keep bringing that A-player energy
- Be a little more open to other team members' ideas, especially the more junior engineers. They might not be the best, or guided by real-world application. Still, it is important to show them that their ideas are valued, even if they might not be fully applicable or the best solution for the given problem, given your broader experience or knowledge about the project at hand.

**Jerod Culpepper:**
Keep doing what you're doing man. You are a natural leader.

**Nick Luckey:**
Asare should keep setting the gold standard for project execution and quality control**.** His ability to consistently deliver error-free, superior results that are "above and beyond" is truly a distinguishing factor and vital to the team's success.

**Eric Whitman:**
Asare should definitely keep doing what he is doing in terms of his tech anchor role. The consistent communication skills of disseminating information between teams and our own is great. I appreciate the shielding from customer-facing scenarios, but don't be afraid to leverage the team when needed for these! Also continue acting as the glue for the team and speaking up when we are going down the wrong path. Continue being the anchor when it comes to planning and keeping our longterm vision in mind.

**Steven Bair:**
- Keep applying that critical analysis and willingness to support collaboration across delivery teams. Your ability to facilitate Idea Meritocracy across boundaries is a key asset.
- Keep bringing others up with you. Continue driving to do the right thing and modeling that behavior for the team.
- Keep gaining experience in Operations and Security. Your development skills are excellent; expanding your understanding of what is needed for ATO and Day 2 Operations (doing What is Required) will significantly increase your value and ability to deliver Outcomes in Production.
- Keep leadership informed on how we can facilitate a working environment that remains a pleasure to be a part of. As we grow, we need your Radical Transparency to help us retain "A players" and ensure the Rise8 culture doesn't just survive, but thrives.

**Nick Weiss:**
Please **continue** to be the foundational pillar of this team. Your combination of deep technical strength and genuine empathy is incredibly rare and is what makes you so trusted. Your willingness to proactively lead, pair with others, and ask insightful questions elevates everyone. Above all, continue to be that crucial voice that seeks to learn and then advocate for what is best for our clients, the company, and the human beings on our team.




You are already operating at an extremely high level as a leader *within* our team. The clear next step is to **start** formally scaling that influence *across* the wider organization. Look for opportunities to take your proactive leadership and advocacy to a bigger stage—whether that's by leading a cross-team technical initiative, mentoring folks in other departments, or presenting your strategic insights on client/company needs to senior leadership. Thanks for all you do!
