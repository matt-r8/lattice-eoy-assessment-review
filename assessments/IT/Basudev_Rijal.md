Since moving over to support IT, he’s taken on a lot of unfamiliar work and handled it with a great attitude. He’s reliable, eager to learn, and follows through once he knows the direction. With more experience and guidance, he’s only going to keep getting better, and I appreciate how willing he is to step up whenever I need help.

Start taking more initiative in identifying what needs to be done before being asked. You have the drive you just need to trust yourself more and lean into problem-solving on your own. The more you try things first, the faster you’ll grow.
**Stop:**
Stop second-guessing yourself or waiting for perfect instructions. You’re more capable than you think, and it’s okay to make a call, try something, or ask clarifying questions early instead of hesitating.
**Keep:**
Keep bringing your positive attitude, willingness to help, and eagerness to learn. You’ve stepped into a ton of new IT tasks and handled them well. Your energy and readiness to jump in make a big difference, and as you keep building experience, your confidence will grow right alongside it.

**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> RJ is passionate about growing as an engineer. I believe he is still in a period of learning how best to learn in a fast moving and quickly evolving environment. That being said, I have witnessed a lot of growth from him since he has joined and believe he has much potential to continue growing.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Start: When encountering a problem that you don't have an immediate solution for, set a timer for yourself and go research the problem and potential solutions for a couple hours. If you still haven't found a solution after that, then go and ask for help from somebody who might know the solution. I have witnessed RJ jumping too quickly to asking for help from AI or other engineers without taking time to research and potentially grow from finding the solution himself, which I believe is slowing his growth and learning.
- Stop: Nothing more to add here besides what I've hinted at in the "start" point.
- Keep: Seeking out opportunities to grow. Not every problem needs to be solved immediately, so sometimes slowing down and using a problem as a learning opportunity is more meaningful than just using the "best practice" solution or asking for help. At RJ's level, I would encourage him to try to find a problem each day that he can think critically about for a while and try to find a different solution for, even if there is a known solution for it already.

I don't have a good stop recommendation.




Keep working towards your technical expertise and mastery of languages and tools without having to rely on AI. It's easier to guide AI when you know the tools a little more.

Because our workflows haven't overlapped significantly in the last four months, I am concerned that my input wouldn't provide the depth that they deserve for their year-end assessment. To ensure their evaluation is based on recent data, I believe it is best for me to decline this specific review so that feedback can be prioritized from colleagues who have collaborated with them more closely during this period.
