### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Teammates would rehire me because:
### 
1. Trusted Operational Partner and Keeper of Confidentiality
- **Unwavering Discretion and Integrity:** I have consistently managed highly sensitive company and personnel data—including access to PII, salary information, and termination details through my support of People Operations and the Facility Security Officer (FSO). My inclusion in Leadership calls demonstrates a high level of trust in my judgment and ability to maintain absolute confidentiality on critical strategic matters.
- **Reliable and Focused Support:** My teammates could consistently rely on me to execute complex, time-sensitive tasks with accuracy. This reliability allowed them to fully devote their attention to their core, mission-critical responsibilities, directly enhancing departmental productivity.




2. **Measurable Time and Cost Savings:** Drive process improvement initiates by automating and optimizing administrative tasks.




3. **Proactive Problem Solving:** I anticipate organizational needs, eliminating potential bottlenecks before they impacted operations.




Overall, I hope in the 6 months that I've been with Rise8, I've been able to reduce administrative friction across the teams, resulting in a release of administrative burden that enables teammates to maximize their core contributions.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Now that I feel like I have a better understanding of Rise8 and our systems, processes, workflows, etc. I want to start with a high-level look at our workflows and find those spots where we might be doing extra work—the duplication that happens during transition periods. My goal is to streamline those processes, make them cohesive and automate the tedious, manual tasks wherever we can, freeing up everyone's time. I'm also planning a serious deep dive into Contracts Administration so I can learn the ropes and offer even stronger support there.




Moving forward, I need to focus my energy. While I love being involved in every part of the organization, I'm aiming to keep my focus tighter in 2026 on three core areas: Leadership Coordination, Contract Administration, and AFSO Support. 




Finally, I really enjoy that people feel comfortable reaching out to me with those "just checkin'" or "silly" questions. I hope Risers keep leaning on me for support! It’s actually a huge help to me, too, because every time someone asks about something that isn't obvious, it flags a gap. I can then jump in and make sure we get a clear written process or quick knowledge hub post created, which ultimately makes things easier for everyone down the line.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. **Enhanced Cross-Functional Efficiency and Real-Time Strategic Visibility**
- **Accomplishment:** Spearheaded the integration and optimization of key internal platforms, specifically deploying Vitally for Customer Success Managers (CSMs) and supporting the Dotwork implementation team.
- **Impact on Mission:** Directly accelerated client management and operational execution. By ensuring platform testing, feature implementation, and user adoption, we are providing our internal teams with real-time visibility connecting high-level business strategy directly to daily operational progress, enabling faster, data-driven decision-making and better alignment with client goals.




2. **Accelerated Riser Deployment and Secured Mission Readiness**
- **Accomplishment:** Transformed and streamlined the security clearance process while taking on adjacent FSO support responsibilities. Key initiatives included creating an automated Riser information collection form and developing a comprehensive Security Canvas for clear communication.
- **Impact on Mission:** Reduced the time-to-impact for new employees. By improving organization and follow-up, we expedited the clearance process, allowing Risers to start making meaningful contributions to customer missions sooner and ensuring continuity of service delivery. 




3. **Established Foundational Administrative Systems for Scalable Operations**
- **Accomplishment:** Organized and stabilized the internal administrative function by establishing SOPs for routine tasks and maintaining a high-level organizational awareness.
- **Impact on Mission:** Guaranteed operational consistency and reduced errors across the board. By formalizing processes, a scalable administrative foundation is formed. This strategic support ensures organizational alignment and frees up mission-critical personnel across the company to focus their energy entirely on achieving client outcomes, rather than managing administrative tasks.

> Christal will need to off-board some current responsibilities as we add resources in different parts of the organization (FSO/Vitally) in order to dive deeper into leadership team management and contract administration.  As she works through that process, we'll want to make sure we find the right balance of responsibilities that meet Rise8's needs and provides Christal with the type of work she finds challenging and rewarding.

**Comment**:
> Christal exemplifies what it takes to be an A Player at Rise8. She's always willing to jump in and take on whatever is thrown at her and quickly excels at it. She easily adapts and figures out what needs to be done without needing a significant amount of guidance, this is an invaluable trait and not something that is easy to find in people. I would absolutely rehire Christal for any role on my team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
- Start focusing on a clear set of priority areas so your time drives the biggest impact.
- Start capturing a few key workflows at a high level so others can step in when needed, I imagine you'll have a team of your own in the near future so this will help off load the many different tasks you currently manage.
**Stop**
- This will be difficult until you have a team of your own but try and stop stretching into ad-hoc work that pulls you away from higher-value responsibilities.
**Keep**
- Keep showing initiative and a “can-do” attitude — it’s been invaluable.
- Keep being dependable and responsive to stakeholders across the company.
- Keep supporting onboarding and cross-team coordination

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser because she brings a huge amount of drive, reliability, and impact to the team. She takes on every task big or small, with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn fast. She never hesitates to jump in, figure things out, and deliver results without needing to be pushed. I can trust her to manage multiple responsibilities at once, communicate clearly, and follow through with high-quality work. Her consistency, ownership, and commitment make her someone any team would be lucky to have again.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
I’d love to see you start stepping even more into leadership moments, sharing your knowledge, mentoring others, and taking on parts of projects where you can influence direction. You’re already incredibly capable, and leaning into that next level would make an even bigger impact. (You are probably already doing this, I just cant see EVERYTHING you are doing from my angle unfortunately, so keep it up if you are) 
**Stop:**
Stop doubting your own expertise. You often know more than you think, and your instincts are solid. Don’t hold back when you have ideas or recommendations your voice adds value.
**Keep:**
Keep bringing your strong work ethic, positive attitude, and willingness to jump in wherever needed. Your ability to learn quickly, take ownership, and consistently deliver high quality work is a huge asset to the team, and it’s one of the reasons people love working with you. Keep that momentum going.

**Comment**:
> What did we do before you????  You have made such a tremendous impact in a very short period of time.  Not only do you have a huge capacity for a diverse workload at any given time, the speed at which you're able to learn new areas and quickly identify process improvements is remarkable.  And you do it all with a calm, kind attitude at basically all times.  We are lucky to have you!

**Comment**:
> If anything, I'd recommend being sure to protect your time and sanity so we don't burn you out.  From an outside perspective, it feels like we've already maximized your workload, and you've definitely earned the right to say you can't take on a new project or to prioritize what you most enjoy doing and ask for help with anything else.  
Also, depending on your growth goals, I can totally envision you leading the team of our increasing Ops/Admin crew and making sure their efforts are connected and supported, not stuck in silos.  Whether that happens by formal reporting structure or informal influence, you are the best positioned to proactively look out for those opportunities and maximize everyone's value as we stand up these new functions.  
Thank you again for all your hard work!
