  "enps_comments": "**Jeff Muller:**\nIt has been great working with Christal again.  Christal consistently takes 100% ownership of projects and ensure all team members complete assignments to achieve the goal.  I'm very excited to have Christal take ownership of leadership team management and contract administration.\n\n**Joseph Andrews:**\nChristal exemplifies what it takes to be an A Player at Rise8. She's always willing to jump in and take on whatever is thrown at her and quickly excels at it. She easily adapts and figures out what needs to be done without needing a significant amount of guidance, this is an invaluable trait and not something that is easy to find in people. I would absolutely rehire Christal for any role on my team.\n\n**Wayland Pearce:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire this Riser because she brings a huge amount of drive, reliability, and impact to the team. She takes on every task big or small, with a positive attitude and a willingness to learn fast. She never hesitates to jump in, figure things out, and deliver results without needing to be pushed. I can trust her to manage multiple responsibilities at once, communicate clearly, and follow through with high-quality work. Her consistency, ownership, and commitment make her someone any team would be lucky to have again.\n\n**Kristin Pearson:**\nWhat did we do before you????  You have made such a tremendous impact in a very short period of time.  Not only do you have a huge capacity for a diverse workload at any given time, the speed at which you're able to learn new areas and quickly identify process improvements is remarkable.  And you do it all with a calm, kind attitude at basically all times.  We are lucky to have you!\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Jeff Muller:**\nChristal will need to off-board some current responsibilities as we add resources in different parts of the organization (FSO/Vitally) in order to dive deeper into leadership team management and contract administration.  As she works through that process, we'll want to make sure we find the right balance of responsibilities that meet Rise8's needs and provides Christal with the type of work she finds challenging and rewarding.\n\n**Joseph Andrews:**\n**Start**\n- Start focusing on a clear set of priority areas so your time drives the biggest impact.\n- Start capturing a few key workflows at a high level so others can step in when needed, I imagine you'll have a team of your own in the near future so this will help off load the many different tasks you currently manage.\n**Stop**\n- This will be difficult until you have a team of your own but try and stop stretching into ad-hoc work that pulls you away from higher-value responsibilities.\n**Keep**\n- Keep showing initiative and a \u201ccan-do\u201d attitude \u2014 it\u2019s been invaluable.\n- Keep being dependable and responsive to stakeholders across the company.\n- Keep supporting onboarding and cross-team coordination\n\n**Wayland Pearce:**\n**Start:**\nI\u2019d love to see you start stepping even more into leadership moments, sharing your knowledge, mentoring others, and taking on parts of projects where you can influence direction. You\u2019re already incredibly capable, and leaning into that next level would make an even bigger impact. (You are probably already doing this, I just cant see EVERYTHING you are doing from my angle unfortunately, so keep it up if you are) \n**Stop:**\nStop doubting your own expertise. You often know more than you think, and your instincts are solid. Don\u2019t hold back when you have ideas or recommendations your voice adds value.\n**Keep:**\nKeep bringing your strong work ethic, positive attitude, and willingness to jump in wherever needed. Your ability to learn quickly, take ownership, and consistently deliver high quality work is a huge asset to the team, and it\u2019s one of the reasons people love working with you. Keep that momentum going.\n\n**Kristin Pearson:**\nIf anything, I'd recommend being sure to protect your time and sanity so we don't burn you out.  From an outside perspective, it feels like we've already maximized your workload, and you've definitely earned the right to say you can't take on a new project or to prioritize what you most enjoy doing and ask for help with anything else.  \nAlso, depending on your growth goals, I can totally envision you leading the team of our increasing Ops/Admin crew and making sure their efforts are connected and supported, not stuck in silos.  Whether that happens by formal reporting structure or informal influence, you are the best positioned to proactively look out for those opportunities and maximize everyone's value as we stand up these new functions.  \nThank you again for all your hard work!\n",
