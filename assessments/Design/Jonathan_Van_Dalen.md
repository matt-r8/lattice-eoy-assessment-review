**Comment**:
> I believe I have demonstrated, especially with the TAK 8-week work, the ability to move quickly, make bold decisions, and embody the Rise8 practices to do what works and what is right. Our team was able to move fast and flexibly, but also in the right direction in a way that made the company and client feel great about the work. I've been given feedback that my approach with design and team interactions helped to bring that dynamic about.




Internal team feedback was positive around having a prototype within the first week, ready to validate with customers, and for keeping a flexible (in solution) but firm (in values/outcome) mindset.




Client feedback came in the forms of statements from SOCOM: "Yi Liu: JB Vernon (SOCOM) called out that he likes the work Jonathan is doing to capture Alex's feedback on our 4.2.x requirements delivery in a spreadsheet. This is a win for us. It confirms that our process for tracking and demonstrating compliance isn't just an internal exercise. It's visible, transparent, and valued by the Program Office." 




and Jordan Boring (aquisition): "I really enjoyed working with your team. It was great seeing how involved you all were, and users appreciate the thoughtful and collaborative approach your team brought"

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Actively seeking challenging projects that lead directly to growth for Rise8. I really enjoyed working on this with TAK, and it was great to be involved with such a self-directed and hungry team.




Stop: I always need to be mindful of when collaboration and feedback internally is faster than working silently, which can quickly become alluring. Moments of collaboration and internal feedback are always helpful and I want to create even more intentional moments for them. I'm great about doing this with users, and I have found it to be just as helpful with the team, so I intend to shake myself out of the "zone" even more often to do this.




Keep: Working fast, showing things quickly, and retaining a flexible attitude towards solution, while being inflexible on values and outcomes.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Successfully completed an awardable (client confirmed we have succeeded on Nov 19) effort for the TAK 8-week protoype, potentially worth $100,000,000 to Rise8 over 5 years.
2. Delivered full scope of Rise8's outcomes in prod promise - not only completing requirements but delivering meaningful features that tie the story of the outcome and mission impact to the delivered product. (via collaborative design studio I facilitated, discovered a feature idea to swipe/draw to relabel buildings, saving operator time and stress, which we delivered in the working product)
3. Supported various proposal and internal efforts including Clearance service mapping at Rise8, the original TAK proposal, VA proposals and prep for proposals, Foreign travel service design internal to Rise8, and creation of design templates and Figma boards including the initial draft of the service blueprint now adopted by the company.

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> 1. Be Bold
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: He took calculated risks in the design execution, but were largely driven by technical constraints provided by engineering rather than a proactive push to disrupt the status quo. He executes boldly once the direction is set but could lead more in the initial push.




2. Do The Right Thing
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: He consistently operated with integrity and a strong commitment to the user and the team. He is a reliable teammate who can be trusted to execute without cutting corners on quality.




3. Do What Works
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: Jonathan reliably validated designs through qualitative methods. However, he relied on the PM to define and measure the deterministic success metrics. To reach the next level, he can independently identify and track the quantitative data that proves his designs are working, rather than relying on soft data like surveys which can be inconsistent.




4. Do What is Required
Ranking: Team Leader
Rationale: Jonathan demonstrated exceptional agility during the Week 1-2 sprint. When engineering identified hard constraints regarding Android panels, he immediately scrapped previous work and pivoted to radial menus without ego. He prioritized shipping a working product over defending designs.




5. Always Be Kind
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: He is a positive, friction-free teammate who collaborates well. However, the lack of observed, direct feedback limits this rating. A Team Leader uses kindness as a foundation to deliver difficult feedback that helps others grow; Jonathan currently leans toward keeping the peace.




6. Keep it Real
Ranking: Team Leader
Rationale: He maintained a detailed journal of assumptions and risks, keeping the team grounded in reality regarding what we didn't know. He was honest about the design trade-offs required by the platform and didn't hide potential pitfalls.




7. Outcomes in Production
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: He delivered the necessary assets to help us move to the next round in the competition. Like the rest of the team, because this did not go to live field production, the rating is capped at the successful delivery of the assignment.




8. Grit
Ranking: Team Leader
Rationale: He maintained high output during intense iteration cycles, testing designs rapidly with users and refining them repeatedly. His persistence was a stabilizing force for the team during the most chaotic phases of the competition.




9. Growth Mindset
Ranking: Solid Performer
Rationale: He adapted well to the Android platform challenges. To improve, he needs to apply this mindset to data fluency—learning how to measure design impact beyond qualitative feedback.




10. No Unnecessary Rules
Ranking: Team Leader
Rationale: He proved he is comfortable in a high-agency environment. He didn't get bogged down in heavy design processes or bureaucracy; he produced lightweight assets that allowed development to move fast, effectively creating his own lean process to match the deadline.




11. I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.
Ranking: Agrees
Rationale: Finding a designer who listens to engineers, pivots without ego, and grinds through strict deadlines is rare. He is a high-value asset to any delivery team and helps the team move faster.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> STOP viewing user surveys as the only source of truth for hypothesis validation. Surveys are ignored by busy users, relying on them creates blind spots. Value other metrics as much as user sentiment.




START defining how a design will be measured before drawing it. Start challenging the PM / Devs if the implementation breaks that metric. Prove your design moves us closer to the target condition.




KEEP the ability to kill your darlings and abandoning designs when technical constraints arise. This is your superpower. I've worked with a lot of designers holding onto their babies. This allowed the team to maintain velocity and avoided the Design vs Engineering war that have hurt my other projects.

**Rating**: 6 - Haven't had the opportunity to observe

**Comment**:
> Jon has shown great core design craft. He takes his responsibilities seriously, which shows in his meticulous preparation for research sessions. When the environment is controlled, Jon performs at a very high level.




Jon's biggest growth area is learning to maintain that confidence when things go off-script. Currently, when a session goes awry, Jon tends to lose his footing, which suggests he is still leaning heavily on the safety net of his notes rather than his intuition. I encourage Jon to practice more dynamic or prep-less interviews—trusting that his foundational knowledge is strong enough to handle unexpected turns.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - Shift away from always starting with 'blank slate' thinking. Currently, he tends to start designs from scratch, which can slow down velocity. Showing maturity means knowing when to reuse existing patterns or strategies to solve problems efficiently, rather than reinventing the wheel every time.




Keep - Commitment to the user. He consistently advocates for user needs, ensuring our decisions are grounded in empathy

**Comment**:
> Jonathan is a skilled and experienced designer, particularly adept at facilitating and synthesizing user feedback. During his recent projects, he demonstrated an impressive speed in grasping complex customer needs and translating those insights into actionable, high-quality design solutions. While his professional demeanor is typically even-keeled and measured, he recently inadvertently conveyed product frustration to the customer during his last engagement, a point to be mindful of for future interactions.
