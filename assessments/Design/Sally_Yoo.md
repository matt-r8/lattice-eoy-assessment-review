**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Although my actual departure is unfortunate (due to new contract prime's decisions), I believe my contributions were highly impactful and strategic.  I strongly believe that my team would enthusiastically advocate for my return!:  
- **Essential Expertise:** I successfully elevated the team’s understanding of user needs by establishing a regular cadence for continuous discovery and by advocating for the user in any discussion that could affect them, a perspective they acknowledge was previously a significant gap.
- **Lasting Deliverables:** I left behind a future dashboard UI design that will ensure design continuity and reduce the burden on the engineering team going forward.
- **Cultural Leadership:** I actively participated in and championed our culture of continuous feedback, which not only helped me grow as a designer and Riser but contributed to a valuable practice of professional candor and improvement across the entire team. (Actual feedback I received: "You bring energy to the team")
I leave the project with deliverables that ensure a smooth transition.  I am confident in my ability to immediately hit the ground running to continue delivering high-value work.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - Stop - dropping the ball on helping PMs identify and submit outcomes, I definitely could’ve done more and followed through on submissions while I was on Tornado.
- Stop - doubting your abilities
Start - being more proactive about *giving* feedback
- Keep - Building and projecting confidence in my knowledge and abilities. 
- Keep - being proactive about *asking* for feedback

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **I. Strategic Impact: Eliminating Research Friction via PRA Exemption**
My strategic action to secure a **PRA exemption** for short-cycle user research significantly impacts our ability to deliver continuous user value, a core element of the Rise8 mission.
- **Mission Impact:** This exemption immediately **streamlined our feedback loop**, allowing us to continue fast, user-centric iterations without being blocked by bureaucratic overhead. It has become critically important as it enables the Secrel team to maintain research velocity despite a significant reduction in dedicated UX resources, ensuring product quality and user-centered design remains high even under tighter staffing.
- **Efficiency Metric:** By bypassing the need for multiple, time-consuming research reviews, we save valuable project time and reduce the administrative burden on the entire team, accelerating our delivery timeline for the VA Lighthouse project.
#### **II. Technical Innovation: Expediting Research and Design with AI Tools**
I achieved my goal of integrating AI tools (Gemini, NotebookLM, Figma Make) to drastically improve research efficiency and knowledge sharing, directly supporting our mission to build effective, modern products.
- **Quantifiable Impact:** I developed a custom Gemini Gem that automates transcription cleanup. For a single 45-minute user interview, this reduced the time required for review and reorganization from 1-1.5 hours to **seconds**, freeing up substantial time for deeper analysis and design work.
- **Knowledge Management:** I leveraged NotebookLM as a curated knowledge base of redacted transcripts, enabling developers to directly query user insights (e.g., "What were users' sentiments about transitioning tools from Snyk to CodeQL?"). This democratizes research, fostering a more informed and user-aware development process.
- **Workflow Acceleration:** I utilized Figma Make to quickly generate "good enough" prototypes of complex PowerBI components, enabling faster design alignment with my PM and accelerating the story-generation phase of our sprints. The best practices implemented were validated by an NN/g course, confirming our approach aligns with industry leaders.
#### **III. Leadership Development: Cross-Team Design Strategy and Mentorship**
I initiated and led a formal, weekly design pairing commitment with my coworker, Alexandra, to practice strategic leadership and increase our combined internal capacity.
- **Mission Impact:** In these sessions, I acted as the "PM," leading the prioritization, goal-setting, ideation, and roadmap creation for a shared project. This process allowed me to actively practice **time management, strategic planning, and stakeholder management**, developing leadership skills that are directly transferable to future Rise8 engagements and client interactions.
- **Internal Capacity:** This collaboration not only provided a needed morale and skill-building boost but also established a model for effective, cross-team design collaboration, ensuring that our internal design community continues to grow in skill and strategic confidence.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Sally is an awesome human with an amazing view of how to build software, and her diverse perspective has been valuable time and time again. She’s often the one person in the room who sees something wrong or just says to take a step back, and she's not afraid to ask questions that might be seen as silly. Her problem-solving approach is more creative, and she is detailed in the most surprising ways. Her bravery and the energy she brings to every meeting are admirable; she's been one of my **favorite designers** to pair with and will be greatly missed as she moves to Torque (eventually).




The main area of feedback is that Sally’s performance can be a bit "spiky": she demonstrates "Best in Grade" behaviors in some areas but has gaps in others (like domain knowledge). For example, she f**acilitates masterfully and is incredibly bold,** but then will not know something about the **domain** that she should. The "verification statuses" issue is a concrete example of this. Based on our RACI chart, the expectation is for her to be the "expert in the user Behavior," and right now she is about 60-80% of the way there.




She is great at being a researcher and has a **superpower** for finding the right way to abstract and anonymize feedback. However, she could be much better at **sharing out** *where* that research is and proactively communicating, "Here's the work I did." While she has started demoing at retros (which is good), product should be seeing five times that as often, and not just designs—documentation, running notes, etc. Our verbal collaboration is excellent, but our written documentation needs improvement - ack that this is a two way street - but it’s one I really wanted Sally to take ownership of.




Finally, one thing Sally does yet help with is user outcomes; it's something I have asked for help on a few times but never gotten any. She's not really outcome-motivated, she's user-motivated, and took a while to get her outcome across the board. This should be a team experience. If I hadn't been there in the release, I feel maybe 60-80% confident she would have helped ensure it was stable, but not enough where I wouldn't have to go check everything myself after.




This "spiky" profile is why this is a tough one. Your **'Bold'** superpower is 100% 'Best in Grade,' as is your **'Exceptional' Growth Mindset**—you're always taking classes and bringing those learnings back. You **'Always Do the Right Thing'** with high integrity, **'Keep it Real'** with praise, and are **'Always Kind'** with your hilarious wit. These are all A-Player traits.




The gaps are what keep you from that 'Best in Grade' tier. The main one is **'Outcomes in Production'**—you rely on product for this. The other is **'Do What Works,'** which is about that domain expertise and strategic pushback. And finally, **'Do What is Required'** is a mix—you do the *important* hard stuff, but you need to **stop** letting those 'annoying minutia tasks' take a long time to get done.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Going forward, I need you to **start** actively owning and helping define user outcomes. **Start** driving to become that domain expert so you aren't surprised by things like 'verification statuses'. **Start** beating product to user insights based on behavior (you did this well with the ASA dashboard, but need it all the way down to the tenants!), and creating a transparent way to show your work. But please, **keep** sharing your classes and how you are learning cool things, then demoing to the team **keep** being bold—that's your superpower. **Keep** bringing that energy, that creative perspective, and that awesome praise for the team.

**Comment**:
> Sally is a true-believer of Rise8’s mission without being a loud evangelist about it. She is definitely an A-Player and I’m distraught that the prime contractor for VA Lighthouse doesn’t see the need to keep her position. She is one of the most unserious serious people I know; she is both super funny but super real and serious with everyone when she needs to be. I was really impressed with her at the offsite. During the practice sessions, she was highly attentive to everything that was being said and done. She always came out with actionable feedback for each session. She is always learning and growing and does what she can to share those experiences with the team in her work and pairing. She is one of the main driving forces the team has for understanding business requirements and designing solutions around that. Would love to work with her again on any team.

**Comment**:
> Everything Sally has been doing this year, she needs to keep doing. She’s actively taking courses to learn things like AI in Figma and UI/UX design techniques. I would love to see her learn deeper about designing and measuring how UX changes affects user behavior. How we can design things to affect better user behavior to get better outcomes? How might we change SecRel processes so tenants deliver faster to production while also delivering more secure applications? It sounds a bit manipulative (and maybe it is), but I've seen great things from focusing on that and those user stories in the past. She's definitely doing these things, but it would be cool to see it at an even deeper level.

> Start:
- Maybe reassess your thermometer/thermostat tendency? I'm not sure how to phrase this well. I do think sometimes you come off as a thermometer, but we all do on the team at some point.
- Being more assertive in working alongside pairs when there's major design decisions being made, such as asking for 'eyes on' during a task to ensure we're aligning to your design vision or to where we need to reassess. I'm not sure if this is 'good practice' from a design perspective or not, but I could see value in it.
Stop:
- No Notes
Keep:
- Being the heartbeat of the team withy our positivity, humor, and drive
- Staying on SecRel pls :(
- Encouraging risers to push for the very best at all times
- Finding ways to break the system to make everyone's lives easier, you have an exceptional skill for this - I'm jealous of it
- Giving your best all day every day without fail

**Comment**:
> I would rehire Sally in a heartbeat because she brings a rare mix of strategic backbone and genuine human empathy to her work. She doesn't just design screens; she actively designs how her team functions.
I saw this clearly when she recognized her team was struggling and stepped in to run norming workshops to get them back on track. She also showed incredible resolve during that massive service blueprint session, managing a room full of conflicting voices that easily could have derailed the whole project. Instead of shrinking back, she guided them to a result.




On top of that, she is smart about how she spends her energy. Consolidating her research requirements into a single authorization so she could move faster was a brilliant move that cut through red tape. But what I value most is her vulnerability. By openly asking for help and showing her "quirky" side, she makes it safe for everyone else to be human, too. She is exactly the kind of person I want in the trenches with me.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start**
- **Start seeing yourself as a teacher.** You mentioned that you feel you are "unfortunately" leadership material because you care more about the team winning than yourself. That isn't unfortunate; it's exactly what makes you a great leader.
- **Start sharing your work.** You have already created templates for norming and card sorting; start sharing those more broadly. You have a natural insight into how people work together—lean into that.
- **Start guiding others.** You are ready to move beyond just contributing your own work and begin guiding the broader team. Consider coaching someone!
**Stop**
- **Stop minimizing your wins.** I noticed in your notes you often say you aren't a "local expert" or "advanced" yet, despite the fact that you’ve successfully pivoted stakeholders from simple forms to full service designs. You don't need a perfect title or a formal acknowledgement to be an expert. Own it!
- **Stop letting anxiety drive your pace.** I want you to stop letting the "anxiety that I need to go faster" make decisions for you. You have great instincts. Lean into them more, even when it's scary.
- **Stop waiting for permission.** If you feel the need to slow down and realign priorities with your PM, trust that feeling. You don't need permission to do the right thing. Plus, it'll earn you more trust and reputation.
**Keep**
- **Keep bridging the gap.** Your ability to translate between design and engineering is a superpower. When you ask questions like, "If a user does X, how does that reflect in the database variables?", you are bridging a gap that often slows teams down.
- **Keep nurturing your allies.** You mentioned that you value allies who keep you honest—keep nurturing those relationships because that safety you create allows everyone around you to do their best work.
- **Keep showing your authentic self.** Please keep showing your hilarious sense of humor AND your vulnerability. It makes it safe for everyone else to be human, too.
