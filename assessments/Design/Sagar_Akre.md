**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Teammates have told me I’m someone they would enthusiastically rehire because I can step into unfamiliar domains and contribute quickly. I’m comfortable taking on responsibilities outside of design, whether that means getting technical, filling in as a PM, or even supporting engineering work when the team needs it.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## **Start Doing**
- Giving direct, candid feedback to teammates, even when it feels uncomfortable, so I can better support their growth and contribute to a higher-performing team.
- Taking the lead in client conversations where framing, alignment, and clarity are needed, instead of deferring to PMs by default.
## **Stop Doing**
- Avoiding difficult feedback because I want to be liked or fear negative consequences.
- Offloading accountability for outcomes to PMs and stepping back from customer-facing ownership when I’m fully capable of driving those discussions.
## **Keep Doing**
- Remaining flexible in my expertise and stepping into PM, engineering, or technical responsibilities when needed.
- Adapting quickly to new domains and filling gaps that help the team move forward.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **1. Independently delivered product features to production on Palantir Foundry**
I played a key role in helping deliver our product to production and personally learned how to ship features end to end within Palantir Foundry. By building this technical capability myself, I reduced dependency on engineering bandwidth, accelerated delivery timelines, and increased our team’s overall versatility. This directly contributed to Rise8’s ability to meet client expectations, demonstrate technical excellence, and operate with a leaner, more efficient team.




**2. Designed and facilitated workshops that improved internal proposal process**
I created structured workshops that helped the Growth team more quickly understand and frame new opportunities. These sessions, used in work like TAK, led to more focused solutioning that the Growth team called out as the most aligned and productive sessions they had run. This approach helped us reach a viable solution more quickly and assemble the right team to execute the plan. It also strengthened our proposal quality and created a scalable pattern we now apply across other opportunities.




**3. Developed a scoping session model that led to new client opportunities**
I helped design the scoping approach we now use with clients, enabling teams to align early, clarify goals, and build shared understanding before work begins. This process has already contributed to at least one to two new opportunities this year, including Torque. These sessions support smoother delivery and give Rise8 a competitive edge by demonstrating our collaborative style, expertise, and ability to bring clarity to messy or ambiguous problem spaces.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Sagar because he is an exceptionally skilled and versatile designer who consistently rises to meet complex challenges. He has thrived in an atypical environment, providing leadership not only in design but, at times, in guiding engineering efforts. Sagar was instrumental in the development of the ODIE dashboard, contributing both to the prototype and to enabling a senior engineer to succeed on the project.




Sagar’s demeanor is one of the best I’ve worked with—easygoing, hardworking, and eager to learn from any discipline. His initiative, adaptability, and collaborative approach have made him a key contributor and a natural mentor to others. As he continues to grow toward a delivery lead role, building confidence in his technical understanding and actively bridging gaps across disciplines will only enhance his impact. Sagar combines technical aptitude, leadership potential, and an exceptional work ethic, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again without hesitation.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ### **START**
- **Calling out process or adherence issues.** Identifying and addressing gaps—even outside of his primary discipline—will strengthen team execution and ensure alignment across projects.
- **Expanding leadership across portfolio-level initiatives.** Taking initiative to guide design, product, and engineering efforts will position him for delivery lead responsibilities.
### 
**STOP / REDUCE**
- **Hesitating to voice concerns or observations outside his primary discipline.** Speaking up proactively will ensure that issues are addressed early and that teams operate optimally.
### 
**KEEP DOING**
- **Delivering high-quality design solutions and prototypes.** His work on the ODIE dashboard and other projects demonstrates both skill and reliability.
- **Building technical confidence and deepening knowledge across platforms.** Continued learning will enhance both his confidence and allow for effective communication between engineering efforts and stakeholders.
- **Supporting and mentoring teammates.** Enabling other team members, including senior engineers, reflects his collaborative and leadership-oriented approach.
- **Maintaining an approachable, positive, and hard-working demeanor.** His attitude fosters strong team cohesion and productive collaboration.
- **Demonstrating initiative and adaptability.** Sagar consistently rises to new challenges and seeks opportunities to learn across disciplines, which makes him an invaluable contributor.

**Comment**:
> Taking initiative is second-nature for Sagar. He's unfazed by new tools or inexperience and consistently works to level up. He's impressively taken on a developer role in Warp Core and has always been enthusiastic in explaining how things are done. He's unfazed when tedious, manual work pops up (we've had our share of these) and cruises through it in short order. He's an astute observer of classification protocol and doesn't hesitate to speak up.

- Sagar can give feedback when it's appropriate. I've been on this team a few months and not received any feedback yet
Stop
- This is tough because Sagar is killing it in my book. He's a key part of our team and I can't think of anything he should stop doing.
Keep doing
- Keep leading by example and showing that tedious or mundane work is easy to knock off the list

**Comment**:
> Sagar is a joy to work with. He is reliable, trustworthy, and incredibly competent practitioner who has expanded his skills and contributions with exposure to Foundry. I highly value his ability to come to conversations with a balance of casual and professional -- he knows how to turn that dial with customer and internally. Sagar has a keen ability to influence through gentle suggestion. He also demonstrates an ability to pick up context quickly in a mission area and jumps across user and technical conversations with ease. I feel confident that when Sagar picks up a task, it will be completed with care, quality and attention. He is an incredibly effective worker who seems to fit more tasks into his day than anyone else on the team.
