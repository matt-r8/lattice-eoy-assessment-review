## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**David Croney:**
Kevin has a deep skillset in design and was always thinking ahead to ensuring the platform we were building would be in the best position to be adopted by actual users. He is an industry leader in design, no doubt. He also combines this with a strong technical grounding that helps him both communicate more broadly and design the right solution for technical users. Kevin is also super collaborative and good to work with. A suggestion for improvement is to communicate his plans and workstreams more explicitly especially to internal stakeholders so they have visibility into the meaningful work he is doing.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
Kevin has admirably stepped up to "dual-hat" as both Product Manager and Designer, operating with great autonomy to define the vision. However, the complexity of this strategic work often creates a disconnect with the team's daily execution. To drive real impact, the focus must shift to simplifying the narrative, ensuring the team actively adopts and owns the direction rather than just receiving it.

**Jake Cook:**
Kevin has taken point as the lead for the Tiger Team and instrumented from the ground-up a baseline of success, agile practices, and mission focused guidance. While in the early stages, would expect his attention to the needs of the team and taking a strong leadership position will ensure delivery and outcomes succeed.

**Jerod Culpepper:**
It's been awesome working with KG. Kevin ran a fantastic risk/assumptions workshop at the start of the Tiger Team that really set the pace for the rest of the work. This, along with his push to define clear goals and epics and his work setting up daily standups, seriously improved our clarity and alignment as a team. Kudos to him for stepping and putting on the PM hat for us!

## Question 12: Start/Stop/Keep Recommendations

### Synthesized Summary

**START:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with START feedback]*

**STOP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with STOP feedback]*

**KEEP:**
*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with KEEP feedback]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**David Croney:**
Start: Providing feedback and your strong opinion especially to teams who may be going off track. Intervene early and often when you see this happening. Being vocal about your contributions and plans.
Stop: Don't feel you need to hold back on having a strong opinion on strategic direction, your input will be valuable as an experienced designer.
Keep: Providing excellent facilitated exercises that bring clarity to the user journey and needs, for example service blueprint and value stream mapping. Keep focused on the outcomes you are looking to drive.

**Joshua Pritchett:**
- **Start** measuring success by adoption and shared understanding rather than just output. While there have been recent improvements, artifacts can still be hard to follow, which makes it difficult for the team to fully buy in. By focusing on simplifying the narrative, the work will not just exist as a deliverable, but become the trusted "source of truth" that is actively used and executed against.
- **Start** prioritizing alignment to ensure your strategy bridges the gap to execution. There is often a disconnect between the high-level vision being produced and the daily reality, creating ambiguity for those absorbing the work. Explicitly mapping how specific artifacts connect to the broader project direction will help the team lock in  and execute.
- **Consider** how simplifying your artifacts could accelerate alignment. Strategic thinking is often deep, but the density of the format can make it harder for the team to digest the core message. By streamlining the presentation to be more accessible, you can lower the barrier to entry and make it much easier for the team to enthusiastically support the momentum.
- **Consider** that the ultimate goal of delivery is "shared ownership." Solid work is being produced, but for it to have maximum impact, the team needs to feel like they own it, too. Focusing on active buy-in, where the team advocates for the direction even when you aren't in the room, will ensure the strategy effectively lands and sticks.
- **Keep** holding a high standard for the product vision. You are taking on the heavy lift of defining the strategy across both design and product disciplines. Your commitment to owning this expanded scope, and balancing the complex needs of both functions on a single team, is valuable.
- **Keep** driving cross-team direction amidst ambiguity. You effectively navigate complex environments without waiting for detailed instructions. Your ability to operate autonomously and define the path forward—especially while managing the scope of two roles—is a recognized strength.

**Jake Cook:**
Keep being a risk-mitigating leader! The eye on risks vs benefits and guiding the team into those conversations while relaying succinctly the team needs to other internal teams and ultimately in front of the customer is what will help us all succeed in these highly visible efforts. The quick communications, time management, and task tracking/organizational skills you've shown help reduce the overhead for everyone and helps everyone to better realize goals at the smallest increments up to the larger view.




Keep going in the self-directed learning to bring yourself up to effective technical understanding to help us all speak the same language effectively. This will pay dividends over the next months/years in implementing Rise8 principles in even greater depth. A+ trait right there, and great leader-driven example.




Recommendation for what could take yourself and the team(s) you lead to the next level of delivery focus is to define daily/weekly/monthly outputs even more clearly so expectations and reality align between yourself, the portfolio broadly, and immediate peer Risers on these engagements. Already instrumenting most of the way, but refining to a slightly clearer would add just that little extra pinch of excellence on top of what you are already doing, and will help show the obsession for delivery and the mission that much more by producing well defined outcomes.




Excellent work overall Kevin, 10/10 Riser! Great team leadership, and excited to see you step into even more technical understanding around some extremely complex systems and environments. You'll be critical in defining a cornerstone of the FORGE portfolio and exactly demonstrate why you are a great fit to lead here at Rise8 and defining what leadership means for high performing teams.

**Jerod Culpepper:**
- Start:  Learning how Github issue boards work. LOL
- Stop: Nothing comes to mind.
- Keep: Continue leading workshops, establishing structure, and helping the team get on the same page. Your approach has created alignment and made a real impact. Continue trying to develop your technical skills.
