  "enps_comments": "**Abel A A Hernandez:**\nYou have made the best of the complicated/challenging hand we were all dealt with this project by stepping up and being supportive and leading efforts cross the balanced team.\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nThis guy is a natural born leader and designer. You give him a lemon, and he'll make design prototypes for a customer interview. He is very influential and one of the easiest persons to talk to about feedback and improvements. I've had the pleasure with working with Sagar for a long time and I am grateful to keep working with him in the future. He is a great teacher and he provides insights/perspectives that help others move the needle. He would be a great portfolio member for any contract.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\nSagar is a highly adaptable and versatile designer who has proactively addressed the account's unique constraints, proving his value beyond traditional design scope. He exhibited exceptional initiative by rapidly achieving technical proficiency in Warp Core, enabling him to directly build UIs and collaboratively ship production updates alongside the engineering team. His recent acquisition of SIPR access further expanded his capability, allowing him to directly contribute to releases and significantly improving deployment velocity.\n\n**Danny Benson:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Sagar because he is an exceptionally skilled and versatile designer who consistently rises to meet complex challenges. He has thrived in an atypical environment, providing leadership not only in design but, at times, in guiding engineering efforts. Sagar was instrumental in the development of the ODIE dashboard, contributing both to the prototype and to enabling a senior engineer to succeed on the project.\n\n\n\n\nSagar\u2019s demeanor is one of the best I\u2019ve worked with\u2014easygoing, hardworking, and eager to learn from any discipline. His initiative, adaptability, and collaborative approach have made him a key contributor and a natural mentor to others. As he continues to grow toward a delivery lead role, building confidence in his technical understanding and actively bridging gaps across disciplines will only enhance his impact. Sagar combines technical aptitude, leadership potential, and an exceptional work ethic, and I would welcome the opportunity to work with him again without hesitation.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nTaking initiative is second-nature for Sagar. He's unfazed by new tools or inexperience and consistently works to level up. He's impressively taken on a developer role in Warp Core and has always been enthusiastic in explaining how things are done. He's unfazed when tedious, manual work pops up (we've had our share of these) and cruises through it in short order. He's an astute observer of classification protocol and doesn't hesitate to speak up.\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nI have only paired with Sagar once before, but from this pairing I can see that he is a very dedicated Riser and is willing to do what is necessary to complete a story. Outside of pairing, he isn't afraid to ask any questions he has in meetings, including meetings where the customer is present.\n\n**Cory:**\nSagar is very dedicated to shipping outcomes. As a Designer, he really gets into the weeds of the low-code no-code and is great at translating between all parties. I would happily rehire Sagar for this team.\n\n**Becca James:**\nSagar is a joy to work with. He is reliable, trustworthy, and incredibly competent practitioner who has expanded his skills and contributions with exposure to Foundry. I highly value his ability to come to conversations with a balance of casual and professional -- he knows how to turn that dial with customer and internally. Sagar has a keen ability to influence through gentle suggestion. He also demonstrates an ability to pick up context quickly in a mission area and jumps across user and technical conversations with ease. I feel confident that when Sagar picks up a task, it will be completed with care, quality and attention. He is an incredibly effective worker who seems to fit more tasks into his day than anyone else on the team.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Abel A A Hernandez:**\n**Start** actively recognizing when your commendable eagerness to help and be of service may lead to overextending yourself. You bring tremendous value across all projects and we need your expertise at 100% every week. Spreading yourself too thin creates a risk of burnout that the entire team depends on avoiding. You should feel empowered to treat your capacity as a strategic resource: **say no** when necessary to protect your focus, and proactively **ask for help** to ensure your contributions remain sustainable and impactful.\n\n\n\n\n**Keep** demonstrating your initiative by **being collaborative and proactively leading or delegating** where you notice gaps or voids in the team's process or work. You are a **selfless teammate** and a **trustworthy practitioner** whose reliability is a significant asset to our success. Please continue this!\n\n**Evan Mladinov:**\nkeep doing all that you do.\n\n**Anthony Zubia:**\n**Start maximizing direct user engagement:** Focus on deepening interactions with end-users through research and testing. The upcoming POSNEG project offers a high-value opportunity to translate user feedback directly into design and implementation decisions.\n\n\n\n\n**Stop over-committing to parallel initiatives:** Focus on strategic prioritization of tasks to ensure his core design and technical contributions are delivered with high quality and focus, avoiding the risk of dilution across too many parallel efforts.\n\n\n\n\n**Continue integrating design and engineering:** Maintain the current high level of contribution by building and shipping features directly within Warp Core, maximizing his cross-functional impact and speed of delivery.\n\n**Dan Bitter:**\nStart\n- Sagar can give feedback when it's appropriate. I've been on this team a few months and not received any feedback yet\nStop\n- This is tough because Sagar is killing it in my book. He's a key part of our team and I can't think of anything he should stop doing.\nKeep doing\n- Keep leading by example and showing that tedious or mundane work is easy to knock off the list\n\n**Kyle Smart:**\nI don't have the most time with you, so I have only limited experience interacting with you, but I do like how you don't hesitate to speak your mind in meetings. I also like how you are willing to put the extra work and effort in to get the stories done.\n\n**Cory:**\nI really appreciate how Sagar communicates. I feel that he takes time to understand the project deeper than necessary to be a strong foundation within the team and to bridge any gaps that happen. The only piece to look at for moving up is leadership skills. I think there is a great foundation for that so far and just keep taking opportunities to lead.\n\n**Becca James:**\nContinue: Finding opportunities stretch your skillset and exposure with your customer.\nStart: Use the trust you have built with the customer to influence. You are a leader on the team and can use that position to drive the portfolio forward in its capacity for delivery.\n",
