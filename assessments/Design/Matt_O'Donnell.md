On G8way, I'm proud I could jump into a fast-moving team with minimal context and quickly deliver what was needed. And with the enablement initiative, I'm genuinely excited I got to listen deeply to my fellow practitioners, understand their real needs, and translate those into insights that can help both our people and our organization grow together.

**Comment**:
> Matt is a highly **positive and enthusiastic** team member whose **curiosity** is contagious. He excels at sharing what he learns, generating excitement within the team. His placement in leading the **design enablement** effort was an excellent fit, leveraging these strengths effectively.




Matt possesses strong instincts for using **research and evidence** to inform his decisions, which is a valuable asset. However, he sometimes over-optimizes for the *optimal* path, which can slow down progress. I recommend he temper this tendency slightly to maintain momentum.




He's a pleasure to work with, known for being a **good sport** and for asking **excellent, thoughtful questions**. He also provides good feedback when prompted and has the valuable ability to state the **uncomfortable truth** when necessary for the team's progress.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep Doing:****Keep being the positive and curious presence,** your enthusiasm is a significant motivator.**Keep asking thoughtful questions** and stating uncomfortable truths when needed for the benefit of the project or team.**Keep leveraging your passion** and knowledge to lead the design enablement initiative.
**Stop Doing:****Stop allowing the search for the absolute optimal path** to overly delay action. While your instinct for research is good, we need to transition to a mindset where a well-researched, educated guess is often sufficient to move forward and gain positive impact more quickly.
**Start Doing:**
- **Start demonstrating a stronger bias for action** in your decision-making, favoring forward momentum over prolonged optimization.
- **Start aggressively and proactively seeking and providing feedback**. While you are already good at engaging in feedback discussions, making this a more frequent and ingrained part of your weekly routine will significantly accelerate both your personal growth and the team's developmental pace.

**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> Matt is a strong practitioner that brings a wealth of experience to teams. He is kind and cares about humans and maintaining strong relationships. He has a growth mindset and reaches out for feedback around how he can improve and be better at his job. He's helped bring energy to those that he works with and can jump into a challenging situation such at the G8way team and deliver in a tough setting.




 There are a couple of areas that would push me from Agree => Strongly Agree.
1. Being more bold: I'd like to see Matt be more transparent with his work and share work and progress more widely to get feedback. I have seen a tendency for Matt to rely on the folks he's built close relationships with to get their feedback and I'd like to see Matt put his work out in the open to get feedback from folks that he hasn't built as close of relationships with. Right now, keeping things close is hiding the work and the progress he's making; from the outside, folks don't see the progress and can question performance.
2. More proactivity: I'd like to see Matt be more proactive in a couple of areas: communication and putting in the effort to stay aligned with the direction Rise8 is heading. On the communications front, I observed a couple of instances where lack of proactive communication from Matt led to surprises or confusion. It's an area I'd focus on to make sure that you are reaching out to the necessary people early and making sure folks are on the same page (one example was around clearly communicating your availability around time off, another around a line of work Matt was owning that had ambiguity around it). On the aligned to Rise8 area, there were a couple of instances where I observed Matt wasn't tracking big Rise8 initiatives that were announced on Slack. In those scenarios, it can reflect poorly on Matt if peers notice he isn't tracking something that is a big company priority.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Taking initiative to grow in the areas you need to grow - I heard you mention on a few occasions how you wanted to get better with Claude, wanted to ramp up in OOUX. Being on the beach is a perfect time to do that, there is no better time to ramp up on those skills than not being on a project.




Stop: (More of a warning) Trust but verify what you get out of what you put into AI. While AI let's you build things quickly, a lot of the fine details can get lost and still needs a human to fine-tune them. Don't lose the details that matter in exchange for speed/ease.




Continue: Continue to ask folks for feedback! Really appreciated how you asked for feedback after a meeting you hosted or when you ask how you can do things better. Keep doing that and everything else will fall into place!

Keep cross collaborating with engineers. Matt was always mindful of what was feasible given constraints and maintainability and I feel that's a good balancing act for a designer to have.
