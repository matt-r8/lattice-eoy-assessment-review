<details>
<summary>View Raw Accomplishments Text</summary>

I moved beyond individual contribution to co-author the 12-month outcome roadmap for Satcom's Mission Workup. By establishing a clear vision backed by user data, I aligned the Nebula team and stakeholders on shared outcomes, directly influencing the long-term product strategy and ensuring we built the right things, not just more things.




I designed and shipped critical validation safeguards that reduced planner review time by 50% and reduced request rework from 95% to 75%. This work directly solved the user's most painful friction points, proving that my designs result in measurable outcomes in production.




I proactively mentored EM&C designers on atomic design and psychology within EM&C. I facilitated an internal design workshop on Accessibility within Rise8. This contributed to a stronger design culture and ensured we are meeting high standards for inclusivity and quality inside and outside of Rise8 organization.

**Minh Nguyen:**
**Start**
As our company embodies AI, I wonder if we have had support for using Claude with Figma. If so, I think you should get a hang of it to boost your productivity and have more time influencing the Kahless Design Team :)
As we get to know our stakeholder and develop a better connection and trust, pushing back and voicing your disagreement when their vision doesn't align with what you have gathered from the users
**Keep**
Voicing your opinions within the team and sharing your family stories. I love to hear those and it helps foster the safe working environment for our team :)
Doing a great job at user engagement meetings and synthesizing information for development work
Influencing the Kahless Design Team with your awesome expertise so we can deliver a better product and the best UX for our customers

**Riya Patel:**
Hannah has gotten great feedback from our EM&C customers and I appreciate that isn't afraid to shy away from feedback or have the tough conversations! 




The only area I think Hannah could strengthen is comfort in speaking to large crowds. It's clear she gets nervous and I think that unintentionally conveys a lack of confidence. I will caveat and say it's a fairly nerve wracking group to present to on EM&C - like 40 people who just stare at you and provide no feedback, so I think any normal person would find it a daunting experience!
