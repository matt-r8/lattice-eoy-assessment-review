  "enps_comments": "**Alex Berner:**\nDamon is relatively new to our team but he has been a strong contributor and a great personality thus far. He has one of the strongest growth mindsets I've worked alongside at Rise8 that drives him to constantly experiment and learn, especially with AI tools, and he has a vast array of design tools and practices to aid with user research and prototyping. I have been impressed with what I have seen so far\n\n**Abbie Burton:**\nDamon joined the team in August and has already made substantial impact. His thoughtfulness, preparation, and research-driven approach have elevated the quality of our work and strengthened our connection with users.\n\n\n\n\nHe collaborated on two site visits, one in person and one for which we prepared content for Alex and Frank. For the in-person visit, Damon created templates for observations, time tracking, SEQ, enabling us to gather baseline metrics on the current Vue app and capture valuable quantitative data. He also developed JTBD questions to ensure we asked the right questions to uncover meaningful insights. Additionally, he created a user interview cheat sheet to help developers who are less familiar with user research feel confident and prepared.\n\n\n\n\nFor the second site visit, Damon introduced a new research method, the highlighter test, to help us better understand how users interact with a specific section of the app and how they perceive the relationships between data. Because of his preparation, Frank and Alex felt confident and were able to conduct all the necessary research on our behalf.\n\n\n\n\nDamon has also been innovative in leveraging AI to build a local prototype, enabling rapid iteration and testing ahead of our WC migration. His design decisions are consistently backed by data and research, and he always strives to elevate the user experience. He actively collaborates with other S31 designers, bringing back best practices and patterns from their applications to strengthen our own.\n\n\n\n\nHe has also taken point on user communications, initiating a communication strategy tracker so we can maintain clear, organized, and consistent engagement with our users.\n\n\n\n\nOverall, Damon\u2019s creativity, rigor, and collaboration have already become invaluable to the team.\n\n**Darius DeSpain:**\nDamon is always kind and helpful. He is on our sister team so I haven't had the opportunity to observe everything, but he has shown me that he cares about the mission and will do what's required to create impact.\n\n**Ian Sperry:**\nI would rehire Damon because he's a highly proactive, innovative, and indispensable designer who consistently set the quality bar for our product. He possesses the core skills and the growth mindset necessary to make an impact.\n\n\n\n\nDamon\u2019s work delivers excellent user experiences that are frequently cited as a major differentiator for the product. His high standards and bias toward action ensure we are always shipping high-quality solutions.\n\n\n\n\nHe actively acts as a leader in innovation by exploring and integrating new tools, like his initiative with AI in his design workflows. This shows he's not just executing tasks; he's thinking forward and trying to level up our collective process.\n\n\n\n\nHe's a dependable teammate, always willing to take on additional tasks and consistently seeks feedback to improve.\n",
  "start_stop_keep": "**Alex Berner:**\nStart turning personal experiments and ideation into documented measurable outcomes to track for the team. You have a lot of drive to innovate and experiment, so there's a great opportunity to align that more closely with Rise8 delivery artifacts and have a scalable and repeatable framework for incepting, progressing, and submitting outcomes. I think you're an awesome person to figure this out for Section 31\n\n\n\n\nKeep up the user research skills and methods you've brought to Section 31, and help share those out among other teams who are less UX inclined and struggling with how to make the most out of limited time with users. The artifacts and exercises you have put together can work super effectively even for engineers going onsite alone which is beneficial to our limited classified environment access, so could even be a playbook for others to use. My only word of caution here is to personally not stick too tightly to the frameworks, and be flexible and adaptable to get what you can from the users even if it's scrappy and outside the box\n\n**Abbie Burton:**\n- Start the OA process early, recognizing that it will take significant time, and leverage Blitzar\u2019s experience to help ensure a smoother path for Malibu.\n- Continue using new research methodologies during site visits to uncover deeper insights into user needs.\n- Continue creating quick prototypes to test ideas rapidly, focusing on functionality rather than perfection since the final versions will be built in WC.\n\n**Darius DeSpain:**\n- start\n   - encouraging other product teams to do site visits. Malibu is the only team that does them consistently\n- stop\n   - Nothing I can think of here\n- keep doing\n   - designing amazing UI for Malibu. Your UI designs are so good that I'm advising we steal them for Starfox.\n   - Pairing with Tom when helpful to work on reusable work between teams\n\n**Ian Sperry:**\nKeep delivering high-quality, differentiating user experiences. He should also continue leading the way in integrating new technologies like AI into his daily work, making sure he stays ahead of the curve in terms of tooling and methodology.\n\n\n\n\nI can't think of anything Damon should stop doing but I will say he should be wary of reacting and pivoting priorities too quickly when recieving new information. Patience and focusing on strategic goals is the key.\n",
