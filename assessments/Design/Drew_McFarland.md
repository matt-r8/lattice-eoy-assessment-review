**Comment**:
> I'm happy with the impact I've had on FORGE this year. The tenant journey is in a much better place because of the work I've done. Leading the early research gave us clear direction when we were spinning, identifying Nova as our pathfinder and mapping the friction points that informed our roadmap.




Reverting to some self-criticism for a second: early in the year I fell into some bad patterns and needed some feedback and real introspection to dig my way out of them. When I'd see problems emerging or bad patterns forming in the portfolio, I'd defer to whoever I thought was the "responsible party" instead of just taking action myself. I had opinions on what needed to happen (I could see us at risk of falling behind) but I'd escalate to leadership rather than step in directly and lead the conversations that needed to happen. I think I was adjusting to the company and lost sight of the flat, action-oriented approach that makes me effective. Regardless, I think if I would have taken bold action sooner, I truly could have driven some conversations that would have gotten us to the point we needed to be as a portfolio. Lesson learned, and moving forward with a "




I've since corrected this. When I see friction or misalignment now, I don't wait for someone else to own it. I try to be very intentional about stepping in and driving the conversation that needs to happen. That shift has made me way more effective, and it's the mindset I'm bringing forward. I know what good looks like, I'm not afraid to be heavy-handed when needed, and I'm committed to acting on problems early rather than watching them compound.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **START:**
I need to get better at advocating for design's role on platform teams. On FORGE, aside from being an inherently engineering-heavy org, delivery teams are pressing toward defined milestones, so I need to proactively educate them on when to engage design and what impact it can have. I have the technical skillset to build credibility here, I just need to use it more intentionally. I also need to find a middle ground with my feedback (direct enough to actually spur action, but calibrated so my passion comes across as conviction instead of intensity.)




**STOP:**
I need to stop worrying so much about being "tactful" that my feedback doesn't land or drive real change. Some level of tact is important, but I've noticed this year that my approach sometimes leads to a different interpretation of the feedback. I have to be direct enough that teammates actually know what to improve. I also need to stop letting my intensity overshadow what I'm trying to say. When I'm passionate about the domain, I want that to energize people, not feel like I'm being aggressive.




**CONTINUE:**
I'm going to keep bringing my get-shit-done mentality and commitment to the mission. I pride myself on being able to do whatever's needed to see things succeed. I'm primarily a designer, but you'll constantly find me working on things that don't fit into that box. I've done some development, led technical conversations with the portfolio, and jumped in to break down and prioritize work for our devs. I think this flexibility to shift my role/mindset to tackle whatever problem the team is facing is my biggest strengthI'm leveraging my technical skillset as a designer who understands the platform. I think that bridge between design and engineering thinking is my unique value prop.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Driving early alignment for key FORGE decisions**
When the portfolio was spinning without a clear customer or path to outcomes, I stepped up to lead stakeholder conversations with government stakeholders (I was really comfortable navigating these conversations). I became an expert on the current Forge deployment process, mapped where friction existed, and worked with our gov stakeholders that to identify Nova as our pathfinder. This work gave the portfolio direction based on real user pain points, and we're now onboarding Nova and working toward actual outcomes.




**Designed and aligned the portfolio on Forge's complete tenant experience from first contact through first deployment.** 
I led the design work covering account creation, onboarding, environment provisioning, and deployment workflows, using service blueprints, journey maps, and friction logs as tools to facilitate alignment conversations across engineering, PM, and leadership. The result is a cohesive, well-thought-out tenant journey that the entire portfolio understands and is building toward. This experience is already yielding impact, as we're onboarding internal apps in under a week and actively using these workflows to onboard our first external tenant.




**Contributions to Rise8 Culture and Design Practices**
I paired with designers to teach them vibe coding and AI tools. I think theres a world where users get access to impactful UX improvements sooner because designers are able to use tools like Claude Code to commit design cleanups and front-end changes, and I'm really excited to keep helping Rise8 work toward that. Separately, I've been pairing with designers on platform design approaches, helping them see what impact design can have on these teams. I'm extremely passionate about the impact a designer can have on a platform team (I've seen it both on the platform side and on the tenant side) so I'm also eager to continue enabling folks on that front. On FORGE, I'm leading the company's first experiment with a centralized design agency model to sense and respond to tenant needs more effectively. We're documenting lessons learned so other projects can adapt this approach when it makes sense. I also served on Prod Patrol vetting outcomes, ensuring that the company is not only tracking outcomes, but communicating our impact in the most effective way possible.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Drew. He consistently demonstrates the hard work and resilience expected of a top performer. He is a highly effective designer and teammate who is not only proactive but embodies the principle of ‘do what works’ by rapidly prototyping, iterating, and failing fast to generate value. His ability to communicate well with stakeholders and customers puts people at ease and makes him a vital Riser for maintaining healthy customer relationships. He is a high-impact contributor and A Player aligned with our mission. It's a pleasure working with Drew!

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Please keep demonstrating your initiative to explore possibilities and different avenues for team success, keep voicing your concerns & opinions, and being a fun & easy-going team member. Your courage to communicate feedback/frustrations/challenges directly while putting people at ease is a perfect example of ‘Always Be Kind’ and ‘Keep it Real’ in practice. To make an even bigger impact, I recommend you start making a more concerted effort to share context from your wider involvements at Rise8 (e.g., Prod Patrol, Tracer, FORGE Design) to ensure the team benefits from your broader visibility across the company. Additionally, I’d like to see you start pairing more frequently with engineers (when it makes sense to) during prototyping and other design activities, as this will facilitate technical input and accelerate the dissemination of knowledge and context throughout the team, fostering stronger team health and growth.

> Start working closely with engineers when designing mocks to see if there can be overlap in tooling to allow them to easily run with it. I only say this because previous mocks were html files in google drive and it was hard to see what was changed and extract it into a repo that follows best practice. To be fair, I did not communicate this to him, so this is a bit nit picky on my part and could have been addressed easily with a short conversation.




I don't not have any stop recommendations.




Keep up the energy and initiative. It is much appreciated and motivating.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Drew. He has had one of the most impressive re-entries into Rise8 that I’ve seen—he hit the ground running within his first couple of weeks and immediately became a driving force in the FORGE portfolio. His ability to conduct meaningful discovery, connect with users and stakeholders, and translate complex domain insights into actionable direction has been invaluable. Drew consistently shows a strong bias for action, filling gaps without waiting to be asked—whether that’s leading research, vibe-coding full apps, or demoing work confidently to high-level stakeholders. He is also incredibly collaborative, kind, and easy to work with. He leads distributed design efforts across the portfolio, prepares clear goals for every workshop, and elevates the quality of both research and strategy conversations. I always feel like I can depend on him, and I consistently learn from his approach. Drew is a huge asset to Rise8 and embodies our values on a daily basis.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:**
Start giving yourself even more credit for the level of influence you’ve built across the entire FORGE portfolio. You stepped in and quickly became a key leader in research, platform understanding, distributed design, and stakeholder alignment—and I’d love to see you continue embracing those strategic moments. You have sharp instincts about tenant onboarding, platform UX, and the broader ecosystem, and sharing those perspectives even more confidently with leads and teams will amplify your impact even further.




**Stop:**
Stop letting the excitement of new ideas pull your attention away from getting some of your strongest experiments into the world. You’ve created incredibly valuable things (like the platform learning simulation tool) and even a very lightweight MVP version would make a huge difference for the company. You already know this about yourself, but defining a clear “minimum releasable” version for your side projects will help you close the loop, ship, and learn in prod. Your ideas are too good to not be used!




**Keep:**
Keep being the fast-moving, thoughtful, and deeply collaborative designer and strategist that you are. Your facilitation skills are some of the best I have seen, and your ability to set clear goals, manage time, guide discussion, and ensure workshops deliver exactly what they are meant to is exceptional. Keep showing up with the same bias for action and cross-portfolio ownership you have demonstrated since your first weeks on FORGE, consistently stepping into whatever gaps need to be filled. Your contributions to Prod Patrol also speak volumes about how much you care about Rise8’s mission and outcomes. And your work on the internal site homepage was another great example, where you took high-level design concepts and vibe-coded them into a functioning experience with impressive speed and care.
