### Question 11
**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> My teammates would rehire because I am a designer that has exceptional cross-functional adaptability and an ability to drive results in a highly technical and complex environment. I rapidly pivoted in my role, moving from a traditional design stack to mastering the Warp Core technical domain, which was essential for maintaining project velocity and relevance on this SpOC/CFC account. Adaptability is the definition of my time here at Rise8 and Bryon Kroger has said on an iRise episode before that the top trait of an A-Player is adaptability.




I consistently provide proactive client management and emotional intelligence in client interactions, ensuring a calm, productive environment. I frequently volunteer for high-visibility demos to our top stakeholders. and key accomplishments include accelerating mission outcomes via OSIT, delivering critical operational tracking capability for 10 SOPS and 7 SWS, designing and implementing an Integrated Training Mode feature for operational risk reduction, providing critical technical enablement for PMs, onboarding new engineers, and collaborating with client SMEs to deliver designs for features such as Status Reversal and Time of Incident.




My success is defined by my ability to persist and deliver high-quality work across both technical and interpersonal challenges, while always maintaining a professional and growth-oriented attitude. Former Portfolio Designer Coby told me when he moved projects, “I'm proud of you and you have persisted through a lot on this account and kept a good attitude.“

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start formalizing user research and feedback loops:** Collaborate directly with Yi and Shawn to establish and execute a scalable plan for user engagement, focusing on translating user needs into measurable design impact.




**Stop allocating significant time to traditional, high-fidelity design artifacts in Figma:** Instead, prioritize implementation-ready design directly within the Warp Core framework and use low-fidelity tools where necessary for rapid concept validation.




**Continue to lead cross-functional design implementation:** Sustain the focus on building, testing, and shipping production features directly within Warp Core, serving as the model for embedded design-engineering collaboration.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. **Accelerating Mission Outcomes via OSIT and Securing Contract Renewal at SpOC HQ**
My first accomplishment was accelerating mission value delivery by personally deploying the on-site build and successful launch of the OSIT MVP at SpOC Headquarters. This direct engagement with the client environment resulted in a highly valuable product that not only earned an internal mission award but also established the necessary trust and operational momentum to secure our contract renewal. This effort perfectly embodies Rise8’s mission by demonstrating rapid Continuous Delivery of Valuable Software that the customer clearly loves and needs.




2. **Delivering Critical Operational Tracking Capability for 10 SOPS and 7 SWS**
My second key accomplishment was delivering critical operational visibility to two major squadrons. For 10 SOPS, I single-handedly developed and launched a specialized OSIT tracking page, providing the organization with its first-ever capability to monitor the status of their systems. I further leveraged this expertise by creating two additional data-tracking resources for 7 SWS to monitor crucial, previously untrackable data points of their systems. This work is a direct example of Rise8’s mission to deliver Valuable Software that significantly improves the user's operational effectiveness, ensuring they have the necessary tools to succeed, and further expanding the fidelity of OPSCAP/SYSCAP data collection for enterprise visibility and decision making purposes.




3. **Designing and Implementing an Integrated Training Mode Feature for Operational Risk Reduction** 
My third key accomplishment was designing and implementing the Training Mode feature, which is a significant step toward Rise8's goal to ensure 'fewer bad things happen because of bad software.' Previously, users relied on low-fidelity PowerPoint slides or paper printouts for training. By delivering this integrated mode, we now allow users to safely practice complex workflows within a realistic operational simulation. The overwhelmingly positive reception, highlighted by a 7 SWS trainer's approval, confirms that this feature significantly improves user proficiency and confidence, directly reducing the risk of costly operational errors in production.

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Anthony Zubia because he consistently demonstrates a willingness to do whatever it takes to make ship happen. He is always eager to learn, quick to adapt, and incredibly easy to work with across every part of the team. Anthony is an asset not only because of his design capability, but because he works equally well with clients, engineers, and delivery managers. 




He helps drive work forward, builds strong relationships, and contributes positively to team dynamics. There is very little I would critique about Anthony; he consistently shows up, delivers, and makes the entire team better.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## **Start Doing**
- Speaking up more and taking greater leadership and ownership in meetings, especially when he has strong opinions or valuable insights to add.
- Leaning into product and strategy conversations to broaden his impact and grow his career beyond design and technical contributions.
## **Stop Doing**
- Signaling uncertainty or using overly deferential, reporting-style language with PMs, the team, or the client.
- Letting himself stay blocked. He should stop trying to solve everything alone and instead reach out early for help or support from teammates who can quickly unblock him.
## **Keep Doing**
- Taking ownership of work and continuing to grow technically, especially by diving into new areas and asking for help when needed.
- Maintaining his collaborative, positive presence and his ability to work smoothly across design, engineering, PMs, and client teams.

**Comment**:
> It’s been a difficult and challenging time on this project. Very little “classic” designing to be done and despite the restrictions Zubes has made the best of the opportunity by becoming proficient in Warpcore workshop building and adjusting his role and skills accordingly.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I understand it's challenging when shifting priorities and having to learn new systems impact your ability to focus on pure Product Design work. However, **Start** being more proactive in understanding and aligning with the product and organizational strategy. I recommend you utilize this alignment to suggest and lead user research initiatives, pushing for more methods to get us in front of users (e.g., user interviews, usability testing, and insights synthesis). I believe the current heavy load of requirements and customer directives has inadvertently limited your focus on leading these critical, high-impact user experience activities, but the opportunities are there. Don't lose sight of them!
