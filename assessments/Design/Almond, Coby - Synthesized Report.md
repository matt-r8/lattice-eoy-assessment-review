## Question 11: eNPS - Peer Comments Summary

### Synthesized Summary

*[AI synthesis needed - invoke rise8-assessment-reviewer agent with eNPS comments]*

<details>
<summary>View Raw eNPS Comments</summary>

**Becca James:**
Coby's presence on a team is immensely beneficial. He is an astute observer of people and understands deeply that most problems are people problems -- and he knows often how to fix it.

**Kevan Mordan:**
Coby thrives in complexity. He has a rare ability to break down difficult problems and lead customers with confidence. His technical rationale is almost always correct, and clients trust his expertise.
However, there is a distinction between being 'correct' and being 'persuasive.' Sometimes, in an effort to be 100% accurate, Coby over explains to the point where he loses stakeholder buy in. To grow, he needs to practice speaking to the current audience—focusing on the big picture rather than every technical nuance.




Similarly, regarding team leadership, he needs to prioritize timeliness over comfort. He currently struggles to deliver difficult performance feedback. He needs to realize that delaying these hard conversations is not 'nice'—it hinders his team’s growth. I want to see him apply the same confidence he shows clients to his internal performance conversations.




That being said, Coby is an exceptional designer and I trust him in high stakes and dynamic environments.

**Ron Golan:**
The headline is that I really value Coby as a teammate and person, love having him on my team, can rely on his seasoned experience as both a researcher and consultant, and know he makes the project more successful. His insights into organizational dynamics and psychology have been so valuable to our project, and gaining an understanding of what is going on at the VA and how to potentially move solutions forward in a way that will be palatable. I am comforted by having him on my team. 




The one area of feedback I have for him is that I'd like him to advocate for, and more directly take ownership of design/research related tasks. I don't want him to wait for me to make space for those activities in the project. I want to make clear that this feedback comes from a place of trust; I know that he that he knows his domain really well, and knows the right time for them. Just go for it!

**Jeremy Arzuaga:**
It's only been two months working with Coby but he's been an easy person to work with.

**Sharon Hamilton:**
Coby's contributions to the ACE delivery team have been exceptionally valuable. His measured and strategic approach—considering both the immediate tasks and the broader Veterans Affairs (VA) context—has been instrumental in developing a robust and effective action plan. His willingness to jump in and explore the customer landscape to better understand the complexity of the situation helped shorten the timeline to completing deliverables and starting additional work. His feedback and partnership within the team helps everyone develop their skills and move faster. Coby is open to feedback and helps develop a collaborative environment on the delivery team and with the customer.

<summary>View Raw Start/Stop/Keep Feedback</summary>

**Becca James:**
Start: Start exercising a stronger bias to action that will help move faster to impactful outcomes.
Continue: Bringing calm, humanity, and joy to the job everyday.

**Kevan Mordan:**
Start - Having the hard conversations and giving feedback as it happens.




Stop - Holding back; don't let perfection be the enemy of good, don't let good be the enemy of starting




Keep - Looking inwards. When you shine you shine bright, follow through with what you find to not only grow yourself but also become a force multiplier.

**Ron Golan:**
Feel the freedom to advocate for the process/activities/structure you think the project needs. Jump in and do the thing you want to be done. But for the most part, just keep being yourself!

**Jeremy Arzuaga:**
He's really great at reading the room and really cares about how to construct the best narrative to show that real problems exist in the organization without blaming and getting people to work toward a common goal. This is going to be crucial for this engagement. Coby has been willing to show others how conduct users interview with how he sets up interview scripts to be more of "mind map" for better flow rather than asking a bunch of questions.

**Sharon Hamilton:**
Start: Sharing more of your experience. Honing your focus.
Continue: Your thoughtful and thorough evaluation of the problem space and your open-minded approach to receiving customer input. Continue being willing to voice concerns and foster communication within the delivery team.
