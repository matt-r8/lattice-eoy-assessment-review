**Comment**:
> My self-rating is rooted in setting strategic direction and delivering transformative results, clearly demonstrated during my time on the Project Mission Workup. Team Nebula's success is evident not only in delivering all roadmap items but in our rapid, high-agency response to numerous last-minute stakeholder requests. This perseverance and commitment led directly to stakeholder feedback that our team "saved the program" and that our team is "the most important team"

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> I moved beyond individual contribution to co-author the 12-month outcome roadmap for Satcom's Mission Workup. By establishing a clear vision backed by user data, I aligned the Nebula team and stakeholders on shared outcomes, directly influencing the long-term product strategy and ensuring we built the right things, not just more things.




I designed and shipped critical validation safeguards that reduced planner review time by 50% and reduced request rework from 95% to 75%. This work directly solved the user's most painful friction points, proving that my designs result in measurable outcomes in production.




I proactively mentored EM&C designers on atomic design and psychology within EM&C. I facilitated an internal design workshop on Accessibility within Rise8. This contributed to a stronger design culture and ensured we are meeting high standards for inclusivity and quality inside and outside of Rise8 organization.

> Hannah has gotten great feedback from our EM&C customers and I appreciate that isn't afraid to shy away from feedback or have the tough conversations! 




The only area I think Hannah could strengthen is comfort in speaking to large crowds. It's clear she gets nervous and I think that unintentionally conveys a lack of confidence. I will caveat and say it's a fairly nerve wracking group to present to on EM&C - like 40 people who just stare at you and provide no feedback, so I think any normal person would find it a daunting experience!
