**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I bring a different perspective to the team, advocating for the tenant app teams and having the team consider what the different touchpoints are for those app team developers. This allows for us to create a more cohesive experience for our users. I have set up regular(ish) user interviews with the Surefire team pretty early on in our project, in order to establish a rapport with them and the rest of the Bifrost team, as well as to de-risk/validate some assumptions we have. I'm continuing to join engineering pairs early on in the work so we can ensure we're considering the users' perspectives as well. I'm always willing to do what's needed and what's right - even flying out for a last minute trip to San Antonio to meet with the ISSMs. I'm also able to carry over some of my experience and knowledge from the S31 side of the program office and Warp Core/Palantir experience. I make sure to collaborate often while being mindful of the engineers' time. I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Keep** building on my technical knowledge in regards to platform as a service. I started working on a guide to help other designers who transition from an app team to a platform team, and I plan to continue developing it and then disseminating to other designers.
- **Keep** sharing and establishing myself as a thought leader on the team, continuing to bring in the perspective of the users and service design practices. 
- **Start** crafting more strategic research plans to orient goals more clearly and better contribute to product strategy.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Contributed to Help Desk/Knowledge Hub and Improved Onboarding for Rise8 
I completed user interviews of new Risers and their onboarding experiences, generated insights and suggestions for improvements for the Onboarding team to prioritize. I helped with the implementation of the knowledge hub canvases by parsing a backlog of FAQs scraped from Slack to display company policies and FAQs, and with the new helpdesk work flows. This was an effort to make it all around easier for Risers to find information that's generally publicly available, and easing some administrative burden on leadership.




2. Expand sphere of influence in the S31 portfolio as a design leader 
I facilitated workshops for another S31 team (Starfox) to help them get their team norming practices in place, as well as create a service blueprint as the team didn't have a designer, in order to help them understand the working of the app. I was also contacted by other designers in the portfolio to go over ways of working with Warp Core/Foundry. I facilitated Damon's onboarding onto the team - with his feedback being "The pairing and rapport-building with you and Abbie was really valuable - exactly what I needed to get into the groove. I definitely take ownership of my own onboarding process, and honestly you did a great job facilitating it. The organic approach worked well for me as I'm backfilling and finding my rhythm with Abbie"




3. Develop and share learnings in service design - 
As mentioned above I've been working on technical knowledge documentation. I created and shared with the Bifrost team a user journey map and service blueprint, 2 artifacts that not everyone has interacted with before. On team Malibu, the engineers had not seen a service blueprint before, and the one I created helped us all figure out how we want to move the Vue app over to Warp Core. I also joined a This is Service Design Thinking book club session and shared how I've applied some of the book's methods to my current project.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> What has been most impressive about Erica is the immense value she has provided *despite* our team's heavy focus on platform and infrastructure, which has offered limited opportunities for traditional design work.
Even without direct design requirements, she has been incredibly proactive. She consistently shows up, delivers valuable consultation to teammates, and works regularly with the Cyber team and our Product Manager. Her contribution has been critical in ensuring that our technical solutions are always viewed through the intended product and user lens, which is an invaluable service to the team.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start:
- "Start proactively defining the design foundation for our upcoming feature work. As we pivot from infrastructure, the team will desperately need the user personas, journey maps, and design principles that you are uniquely qualified to build. I'd love to see you start creating those assets *now*, so you can lead the product vision instead of just responding to it."
Stop:
- I would encourage you to stop *waiting* for a 'design requirement' to get involved. Your proactive consultation with the PM and Cyber teams is already so valuable, so please continue to inject yourself into those conversations.
Keep:
- Keep acting as the user-centric conscience for the team. It's so important.
- Keep showing up and staying engaged, even when the work isn't directly in your wheelhouse. Your resilience and proactiveness are noticed and valued.
- Keep collaborating across teams (like Cyber and Product). It ensures we are all building in the same, intentional direction.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Continue: Keep comparing the release processes (bifrost and previous s31 apps) as you know it. I think that having your insight onto how previous apps such as surefire used to deploy and their process really helps us compare what we have, and what we need to do. It really puts into perspective where Bifrost is/is going. 




Continue: When our team has larger discussions, you are always one to reference back to our stakeholder meetings. Like if we have a question and get stuck, just move on and take note to ask our stakeholder. It really helps our team stay on track to what we really wanted answered, and not spiral into hypothetical what if's.

**Comment**:
> This is difficult to write but I sincerely have not been in conversations where Erica is taking a large enough role in the conversation to fully understand her role and value-add to the team. It's difficult for me to know what Erica's priorities are as there is minimal description of the tasks she is delivering on in our backlog nor are the reports in standup offering enough context to see meaningful delivery.  I can fully understand that perhaps the Bifrost team simply is not offering the right opportunities for Erica to make valuable contribution.

**Comment**:
> Start finding more opportunities to assist the team in ways adjacent to the skill of designer, such as: facilitation of value stream maps, revisiting of team documents for maintaining their quality, providing high fidelity visualizations of our security domain or proposed system architecture. Start engaging more in team discussion and look for opportunities to get spun up on complicated topics if you feel you might not have context.

> Erica has extremely valuable person to have on the Bifrost team, not just for her design skills, but all the other things she brings to the project: e.g., collaboration, knowledge sharing, and context.  She brought a wealth of knowledge about Surefire that was instrumental in onboarding them and driving the ATO conversations.  She dives into client communications by helping build decks.  She communicates across disciplines, bridging cyber security, engineering and product. She knows all the things and she helps keep everyone aligned, in addition to building design assets and advancing the overall product vision.

> Start: Driving the overall design process for the team.  This is hard/weird on a platform team, but for things like observability dashboards or other interfaces we control, don't wait for anyone to specify how that process is going to work.  Put your suggestions out there, pick up feedback as needed and move it forward.  If you're in charge, take charge :)




Continue: Bringing your knowledge, sensibility and good ideas into every conversation.  You are always there with helpful information, relevant context, and solid next next steps.  You helped out a lot in areas that didn't have an obvious designer take, which makes you super valuable as a teammate well beyond your role.
