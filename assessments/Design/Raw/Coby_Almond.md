> # The Human Side of the Work
Solving hard problems takes more than just technical craft. It requires a steady hand when things get messy, and a vision rooted in what is meaningful to people. Here is how I show up to build that stability and guide that direction.




**Finding the Signal** 
We all know the specific sensation of a project starting to spiral—the noise gets loud, deadlines slip, and the collective anxiety spikes. In those moments, it’s easy to feel like the only option is to panic. My role is to be the anchor in that noise. I’ve learned that the most valuable thing I can bring to a heated moment is a cool head. Externally, I hold the space for the client so they feel safe; internally, I find a quiet hyper-focus to get the actual work done. This stability allows the team to breathe, stopping us from reacting to the fear so we can start responding to the problem.




**Building Fluency Together** 
Clients often come to us asking for the wrong things, hoping we’ll just "fix it" for them like magic. But handing over a shiny solution they don't understand is, in my view, a form of miscommunication. I treat design as a conversation, not a delivery. I invite clients into the messy middle—the "doing with" rather than the "doing for"—so we can get our hands dirty together. By the time we reach the solution, they trust it because they helped build the logic behind it. We move from a transactional relationship to a true partnership, leaving the client with a new fluency in solving their own problems.




**Teaching the Language** 
It is painful to watch a junior designer stuck on the "syntax" of a problem—trying to make an articulation look right without knowing why it *is* right. Shame is a killer here; it stops them from asking for help. I don't want to just fix their solution; I want to show them the pattern in their reasoning. I strive to create a space where it’s safe to be wrong, encouraging them to dig for the insight and the evidence. It’s about teaching the grammar of design, not just the vocabulary. This builds a resilient team that knows their value isn't in knowing the answer immediately, but in knowing how to find it rigorously.




**The Discipline of Timing** T
here is a rhythm to every meeting and a pulse to every project. Often, success comes from the patience of reading the room—withholding my input until the window of receptivity opens so the idea actually takes root. But there is a vital flip side to that coin: knowing when to stop waiting and drop a hard truth. Sometimes the most supportive thing I can do is interrupt the flow to say the thing no one else wants to say. It’s a discipline of discernment—knowing when to wait for the ground to be prepared, and when to break the ground myself because the person needs the truth more than they need comfort.




**The Work is Relational** 
"Wicked problems" are exhausting. If we aren't careful, the complexity grinds us down, and we lose sight of the people behind the pixels. I ground my work in loving-kindness. It sounds soft, but it’s the hardest, most practical tool I have. It means treating a frustrated client with curiosity instead of defense, and a struggling teammate with patience instead of judgment. This practice prevents the burnout that hollows out high-performing teams. It reminds us that we are humans working with humans, and that *is* the work.

> # Internal Navigation: Start / Stop / Keep
*A personal heuristic for balancing rigor with rapid delivery.*




## STOP (Breaking the Loop)
**Stop projecting past trauma onto current opportunities.**
- *The Trap:* Letting scars from past organizational abuse or poor leadership dictate my caution now. I sometimes hesitate to act boldly because I am bracing for a punishment or betrayal that isn't coming.
- *The Fix:* Shed the old armor. Focus on my own agency and power. I am here to advance the good, and I have the authority to do so. I will act from a place of hopeful strength, not defensive fear.
**Stop auditing the request before acknowledging the receipt.**
- *The Trap:* When a request comes in (e.g., "Use a service blueprint"), my brain immediately spots why it’s the wrong tool. I risk freezing progress to debate the method.
- *The Fix:* Stop letting the critique be the *first* thing they hear. Demonstrate eagerness to try to meet the request alongside curiosity in what they hope to accomplish. The reality of the solution will reveal itself soon enough and I’ll have my opportunity to help.
**Stop applying "Full Rigor" to Low-Risk items.**
- *The Trap:* Suggesting deep articulation and validation for a small assumption or internal feature (like a simple admin panel). Being "theoretically right" (it *should* be evaluated) but "contextually wrong" (we don't have time/risk is low) isolates you from your team.
- *The Fix:* Stop treating every feature like a high-stakes product launch. If the cost of being wrong is low, skip the philosophy and just execute the design while acknowledging what we want to learn from it in time.
**Stop waiting for the "Whole System" view.**
- *The Trap:* I want to understand the entire ecosystem before moving an inch. This is great for architecture but fatal for momentum.
- *The Fix:* Stop holding back the brick because I haven't finished the blueprint. The team often needs a brick. Make it, then go back to constructing my view.




## START (New Protocols)
**Start calibrating process to risk.**
- *The Practice:* Before suggesting a process, ask: **"How bad is it if we make the wrong decision here?"**
- *The Why:* If the answer is "not that bad," I must guide the team toward a pragmatic short-term solution, not a validated one.
**Start shipping the visible "Bad" Version immediately.**
- *The Practice:* Bias for visible action. If asked for an artifact, ship a rough, ugly draft and iterate.
- *The Why:* "Seeing is believing." An imperfect artifact on the table buys me the trust and time to say, "Now that we see this, here is why I think we should change direction."
**Start leveraging AI as a sketchpad for the "50% Solution."**
- *The Practice:* Use AI tools to generate the initial "Lego bricks"—rough drafts or prototypes—to break the inertia of the blank page. Be willing to throw things away quickly and know when to stop using the tool. Tread carefully.
- *The Why:* It helps me produce the "bad" version faster. By getting a 50% solution on the table immediately, I can stop building and get to the valuable conversations and outcomes that actually matter.
**Start explicit mode-switching: "Builder" vs. "Architect."**
- *The Practice:* verbalize my state. "I am putting on my Builder hat to get this shipped," or "Can I switch to Architect mode for five minutes to discuss a risk?"
- *The Why:* It prevents people from thinking my philosophical pushback is just reluctance to do the work.
**Start cultivating a public voice.**
- *The Practice:* Contribute to the larger design and GovTech conversation through consistent writing and public speaking.
- *The Why:* It forces me to clarify my own thinking. By articulating my perspective publicly, I sharpen the "voice" I bring back to the team and contribute to the maturity of our field.




## KEEP (The Core Operating System)
**Keep decoding the subtext.**
- *The Value:* Continue reading between the lines. My ability to clarify what people are *implying* (not just saying) is a superpower. Use this to clarify the *goal*, even if the *method* needs to speed up.
**Keep the Discipline of Timing.**
- *The Value:* Maintain the balance between patience and boldness. Continue to wait for the room to be receptive, but do not shy away from the "hard truth" when it is needed to prevent failure. Know when to wait for the ground to be prepared, and when to break the ground myself.
**Keep being the Anchor.**
- *The Value:* When the deadline slips and the noise rises, stay calm. Do not let the need for speed induce panic. Internalize the urgency, but externalize stability.
**Keep "Doing With, Not For."**
- *The Value:* Don't retreat to a cave to build the perfect solution. Drag the client/stakeholder into the mud with me. The friction of collaboration is where the trust is built.
**Keep the Loving-Kindness.**
- *The Value:* Continue to view frustration (mine and theirs) with curiosity. When a teammate or leader is agitated about a lack of delivery, it’s not because they are unreasonable; it’s because they are scared of a lack of progress. Meet the fear, not just the demand.

> # Three Core Accomplishments




## 1. The Big Bet: Establishing the SpOC CFE "Software Factory"
**What I did:** The SpOC Combat Force Enhancement division faced a critical risk: they needed to operate as a software factory but lacked the agile organizational design and staffing to ship value on the Warp Core platform. I stepped in to co-lead their portfolio design strategy, implementing growth boards and opportunity sourcing processes. With some difficult feedback, I helped guide the Director and Deputy Director through essential staffing changes and process adoption. This foundation enabled them to recently scope and kick off discovery on their own sourced and prioritized opportunity—a first for the organization—proving they can now operate more independently and earn even more credibility in the Command. While I was unable to win the ongoing commitment to larger service design initiatives, I am proud that I was able to lay the groundwork for continuous improvement and grow opportunity selection maturity before departing the account.




## 2. The Strategic Win: Pivoting the Mission (OPT Gantt Chart)
**What I did:** My SpOC portfolio team was assigned a business-process task from a senior leader (tracking operational planning teams, OPTs) that didn't fit our combat capability mission. Instead of fighting it, I rallied the team to design and build a Gantt chart solution in Warp Core in just 6 weeks. We handed it off successfully to the right team (S7/3/9), using that success to prove our credibility and delivery chops and convince senior leadership to let Combat Force Enhancement return to our core mission (and of its importance). This experience also taught CFE leadership a valuable lesson in navigating high-stakes negotiations with their senior leadership and how to fight for the right to prioritize their own bets.




## 3. The Cultural Win: Coaching for Agency and Resilience
**What I did:** Beyond technical delivery, I invested deeply in the professional resilience of my teammates—specifically guiding peers like Sally Yoo, Nick Mendiola, Sagar Akre, and Anthony Zubia through high-stakes interpersonal and professional challenges. I didn't just offer sympathy; I helped them practice the difficult articulation of their own advocacy. I coached them to deeply seek to understand the context first, teaching them the skills necessary to look behind the face value of information as it is presented and to rigorously evaluate underlying assumptions. This discipline empowered them to form strong opinions and bring a valuable, distinct point of view to their teams. We role-played the conversations, stripping away the anxiety to find the clear signal of their intent. It was about cultivating the fluency to be fully understood. This preparation allowed them to walk into crucial meetings with the steadiness to be heard and the agency to build trust.

**Comment**:
> Coby thrives in complexity. He has a rare ability to break down difficult problems and lead customers with confidence. His technical rationale is almost always correct, and clients trust his expertise.
However, there is a distinction between being 'correct' and being 'persuasive.' Sometimes, in an effort to be 100% accurate, Coby over explains to the point where he loses stakeholder buy in. To grow, he needs to practice speaking to the current audience—focusing on the big picture rather than every technical nuance.




Similarly, regarding team leadership, he needs to prioritize timeliness over comfort. He currently struggles to deliver difficult performance feedback. He needs to realize that delaying these hard conversations is not 'nice'—it hinders his team’s growth. I want to see him apply the same confidence he shows clients to his internal performance conversations.




That being said, Coby is an exceptional designer and I trust him in high stakes and dynamic environments.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start - Having the hard conversations and giving feedback as it happens.




Stop - Holding back; don't let perfection be the enemy of good, don't let good be the enemy of starting




Keep - Looking inwards. When you shine you shine bright, follow through with what you find to not only grow yourself but also become a force multiplier.

> The headline is that I really value Coby as a teammate and person, love having him on my team, can rely on his seasoned experience as both a researcher and consultant, and know he makes the project more successful. His insights into organizational dynamics and psychology have been so valuable to our project, and gaining an understanding of what is going on at the VA and how to potentially move solutions forward in a way that will be palatable. I am comforted by having him on my team. 




The one area of feedback I have for him is that I'd like him to advocate for, and more directly take ownership of design/research related tasks. I don't want him to wait for me to make space for those activities in the project. I want to make clear that this feedback comes from a place of trust; I know that he that he knows his domain really well, and knows the right time for them. Just go for it!
