**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would absolutely enthusiastically rehire myself for this role, as I've tried to shape my work to focus on strategic impact and team leadership. I work to be comfortable with ambiguity and do my best to alleviate red tape, navigating bureaucracy and information silos to secure clarity for our team's forward momentum. My priority is championing a psychologically safe environment where every team member feels confident contributing, strengthening our collaboration regardless of the conversation or attendees.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep: Continue participating in the forward growth of the design discipline by impactful initiatives like the successful offsite. For the next iteration, expand the scope to intentionally include Developers to further strengthen cross-functional collaboration and knowledge sharing.




Stop: Stop setting internal expectations or applying assumptions about the background, process maturity, or technical history of systems outside my control, as there is a lack of necessary context and understanding of their internal constraints. Instead, work with them directly to collaboratively define and implement incremental process improvements. This shifts the dynamic from vendor-vendor policing to a shared, constructive partnership. 




Start: With our new project upcoming, start expanding your efforts toward achieving a united front by continuing to gain crucial cross-organizational influence for the Rise 8 teams working on the EMC contract. This focus will be particularly vital in aligning efforts and expectations for design.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. As the designer on the MOSS team, we achieved success by delivering nearly a third of the entire company’s 38 outcomes for the first half of the year. The measurable output of this single team was a significant contribution to Rise 8's mission success. This consistent delivery and cultural leadership were primary factors in the team earning the prestigious Dream Team Award at this year's company offsite, honoring us "For Exemplifying What It Means to Rise Up!" Furthermore, our team made Rise 8 history by successfully executing the first-ever prospect pairing with a Rise 8 software team in collaboration with Growth, establishing a crucial new model for future cross-organizational collaboration and learning. 
2. I partnered with a small team to conceptualize, plan, and execute an offsite event for both the Design and Project Management disciplines, demonstrating leadership in growing organizational capability. This initiative was strategically designed to foster collaboration, build culture, and deliver practical education. The offsite was deemed a significant success, directly contributing to our shared team culture and ensuring that participants gained actionable, relevant skills that they have since successfully incorporated into their daily projects
3. I contributed critical initiative, in collaboration with two other Rise 8 designers, focused on organizational transformation and external influence. Our work moved beyond single-product scope to directly influence 3rd party design contractors and establish new standards within a highly restrictive mandatory system. We achieved significant early progress in setting a unified, high-quality design standard that will streamline delivery for the remainder of this contract. This effort required actively engaging with and persuading key decision-makers, resulting in measurable progress in shifting mindsets and opening the door for future systemic design investment and change across the broader organization.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Darla because she's a fantastic, high-impact Senior Designer who immediately elevated our team's strategic focus, execution quality, and health. She's a relentlessly outcome-focused leader whose contributions actively made my job easier.




Darla successfully navigated the difficult dynamics of designing within the complex Kahless system, showing the poise and organizational savvy needed to drive design decisions even when facing resistance to simple changes. This confirms her ability to handle L6-level ambiguity and complexity.




She immediately stepped into a leadership role by introducing high-leverage practices, such as engaging engineers in the outcome submission process and initiating the rotating retro host idea. These actions demonstrate her ability to coach others and lead initiatives across teams.




Her great curiosity and strong organizational skills significantly improved the quality of outcome documentation and made life much easier for the developers through organized design handoffs.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep driving strategic process improvements across the cross-functional team, such as her work on the outcome submission and retros. She must also maintain her high level of organizational excellence and clarity in her handoffs, especially as the team embarks on the new project. She should continue to demonstrate poise while navigating organizational complexity—that is the key to her strategic impact.




Start planning and coordinating research share outs to the rest of the team as we embark on the discover work for Protected Band Workup.




There is nothing Darla should stop doing at this time. She is operating as an exceptional Senior Designer and should continue applying her organizational, design, and coaching skills.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I strongly agree that I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.  Darla joined our team at an unusual phase, with a lot of stop-gap work and a design group from Kahless that isn't always user-centric or decisive.  Despite this, she immediately brought clarity and value by asking great user-focused questions and pushing conversations toward real outcomes in conversations with the design team.  Her ability to work effectively with the Kahless design team, advocate for users, and even help guide their decision process has made a huge difference.  She has also made an effort to further include engineers in outcome planning, ensuring design, product, and engineering are aligned early and working together as a true balanced team.  She’s been collaborative, thoughtful, and outcome-driven from day one.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Keep:**
Your outcome focused approach and the way you anchor conversations in user needs.  You've been great at collaborating with devs and navigating the often unclear handoffs from the Kahless design system and advocating for outcomes during our stop-gap work.

Darla is transparent with teammates and stakeholders, and is able to ask the tough—or even obvious—questions that allow us to make decisions and move fast. She demonstrates Rise8 ideals and is clearly passionate about the mission. Even though I mostly observe her in team meetings and workshops, her value to the team is evident in the way she moves quickly and takes ownership of everything she does.

**Comment**:
> Darla made significant and immediate contributions to the team's processes and quality as soon as she joined.




She quickly integrated herself by seeking out current team preferences and proactively suggested targeted improvements where processes felt disorganized or inefficient.




Her direct experience with production outcomes (gained from her time on the Prod Patrol) has been invaluable. She has directly helped the team significantly improve our quality and reliability metrics in production.




Darla excels at fostering a healthy and inclusive team communication environment. She provides clear, direct feedback to teammates and is never afraid to voice her opinions or raise potential concerns, contributing to high-quality discussions. She is highly skilled at noticing when teammates are quiet and actively gives them the floor, creating opportunities for less vocal individuals to contribute their insights.




Darla actively represents Rise8's core values, helping to instill a culture of moving fast, experimenting, and prioritizing continuous feedback. She acts as a mentor for customers and other vendors, demonstrating and encouraging a bias for action and learning quickly, rather than waiting for lengthy approval chains.

We haven't had real opportunities yet since we are not assigned to our next project within EM&C, but I'm curious to see your strategic focus applied to our user discovery efforts through the use of AI. It would be great for user discovery to be summarized, tagged, and organized in a searchable manner that enables any team member (Product, Design, or Engineering) to easily find the information they need without digging through extensive original notes.
