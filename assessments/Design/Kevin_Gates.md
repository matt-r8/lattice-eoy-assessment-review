**I believe I would be enthusiastically rehired for my role on my team.**

**Rating**: 4 - Agree

**Comment**:
> I got a lot of unsolicited feedback from the Tiger team that they like what I brought as a PM to Framework Services: I ran a workshop to get clear articulations of risks and mitigations, clear outcome-based goals, and strategic vision. After mitigating risks and getting the project kicked off, we shipped functioning code within two weeks and presented to government stakeholders. I also maintain and foster a partnership with SDL and am getting close to my goal: Actual weekly pairing sessions with specific problems and not just information exchange. When I run meetings, they have agendas, and if we get through them, I end the meeting early and send out action items. Engineers like this.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: 1) Get more hands-on with k8s. I've installed minikube locally with podman. I want to continue this and teach other designers and PMs. Technical knowledge in my experience really comes from doing. 2) Learn what I currently don't know I need to learn. I wouldn't mind and evaluation from a staff PM and what I can improve, in addition to other feedback.




Stop: Creating artifacts without clear articulation of the value we want from them. Activities should have clear outcomes and outputs that kickstart the next thing we are doing. We created good artifacts (service blue print) but did not extract the kind of value from it I like to see. The key is to start with the problems (align teams, identify areas that need design work, spin out new work, etc), then strip the design process to the bare essentials and go fast (the assumptions and risks workshop followed this: we prioritized risks and mitigations and got tickets into the backlog and shipped within two weeks.)




Keep: Create workshops and other activities have clear objectives and are lean.

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1) Kicked off Tiger team with assumptions and risks that brought clarity and focus. Unpacked engineering work and sussed out implied assumptions with the team. After that, the epic wrote itself and we got prioritized tickets into the backlog
2) Got a Framework Services Demo for gov stakeholders out the door early.
3) Laid out Tiger team strategy including outcome oriented roadmap and tactics to mitigate risks.

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> Kevin has a deep skillset in design and was always thinking ahead to ensuring the platform we were building would be in the best position to be adopted by actual users. He is an industry leader in design, no doubt. He also combines this with a strong technical grounding that helps him both communicate more broadly and design the right solution for technical users. Kevin is also super collaborative and good to work with. A suggestion for improvement is to communicate his plans and workstreams more explicitly especially to internal stakeholders so they have visibility into the meaningful work he is doing.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Start: Providing feedback and your strong opinion especially to teams who may be going off track. Intervene early and often when you see this happening. Being vocal about your contributions and plans.
Stop: Don't feel you need to hold back on having a strong opinion on strategic direction, your input will be valuable as an experienced designer.
Keep: Providing excellent facilitated exercises that bring clarity to the user journey and needs, for example service blueprint and value stream mapping. Keep focused on the outcomes you are looking to drive.

**I would enthusiastically rehire this Riser for their role on my team.**

**Rating**: 3 - Neutral

**Comment**:
> Kevin has admirably stepped up to "dual-hat" as both Product Manager and Designer, operating with great autonomy to define the vision. However, the complexity of this strategic work often creates a disconnect with the team's daily execution. To drive real impact, the focus must shift to simplifying the narrative, ensuring the team actively adopts and owns the direction rather than just receiving it.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> - **Start** measuring success by adoption and shared understanding rather than just output. While there have been recent improvements, artifacts can still be hard to follow, which makes it difficult for the team to fully buy in. By focusing on simplifying the narrative, the work will not just exist as a deliverable, but become the trusted "source of truth" that is actively used and executed against.
- **Start** prioritizing alignment to ensure your strategy bridges the gap to execution. There is often a disconnect between the high-level vision being produced and the daily reality, creating ambiguity for those absorbing the work. Explicitly mapping how specific artifacts connect to the broader project direction will help the team lock in  and execute.
- **Consider** how simplifying your artifacts could accelerate alignment. Strategic thinking is often deep, but the density of the format can make it harder for the team to digest the core message. By streamlining the presentation to be more accessible, you can lower the barrier to entry and make it much easier for the team to enthusiastically support the momentum.
- **Consider** that the ultimate goal of delivery is "shared ownership." Solid work is being produced, but for it to have maximum impact, the team needs to feel like they own it, too. Focusing on active buy-in, where the team advocates for the direction even when you aren't in the room, will ensure the strategy effectively lands and sticks.
- **Keep** holding a high standard for the product vision. You are taking on the heavy lift of defining the strategy across both design and product disciplines. Your commitment to owning this expanded scope, and balancing the complex needs of both functions on a single team, is valuable.
- **Keep** driving cross-team direction amidst ambiguity. You effectively navigate complex environments without waiting for detailed instructions. Your ability to operate autonomously and define the path forward—especially while managing the scope of two roles—is a recognized strength.

**Comment**:
> Kevin has taken point as the lead for the Tiger Team and instrumented from the ground-up a baseline of success, agile practices, and mission focused guidance. While in the early stages, would expect his attention to the needs of the team and taking a strong leadership position will ensure delivery and outcomes succeed.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> Keep being a risk-mitigating leader! The eye on risks vs benefits and guiding the team into those conversations while relaying succinctly the team needs to other internal teams and ultimately in front of the customer is what will help us all succeed in these highly visible efforts. The quick communications, time management, and task tracking/organizational skills you've shown help reduce the overhead for everyone and helps everyone to better realize goals at the smallest increments up to the larger view.




Keep going in the self-directed learning to bring yourself up to effective technical understanding to help us all speak the same language effectively. This will pay dividends over the next months/years in implementing Rise8 principles in even greater depth. A+ trait right there, and great leader-driven example.




Recommendation for what could take yourself and the team(s) you lead to the next level of delivery focus is to define daily/weekly/monthly outputs even more clearly so expectations and reality align between yourself, the portfolio broadly, and immediate peer Risers on these engagements. Already instrumenting most of the way, but refining to a slightly clearer would add just that little extra pinch of excellence on top of what you are already doing, and will help show the obsession for delivery and the mission that much more by producing well defined outcomes.




Excellent work overall Kevin, 10/10 Riser! Great team leadership, and excited to see you step into even more technical understanding around some extremely complex systems and environments. You'll be critical in defining a cornerstone of the FORGE portfolio and exactly demonstrate why you are a great fit to lead here at Rise8 and defining what leadership means for high performing teams.

> It's been awesome working with KG. Kevin ran a fantastic risk/assumptions workshop at the start of the Tiger Team that really set the pace for the rest of the work. This, along with his push to define clear goals and epics and his work setting up daily standups, seriously improved our clarity and alignment as a team. Kudos to him for stepping and putting on the PM hat for us!

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> #### **1. KEEP: Strategic Alignment & Expanding Operational Knowledge**




- **Keep leveraging your unique hybrid background.** Your ability to understand both the design and engineering landscapes is a massive asset. It allows you to see the strategic picture and future roadmap clearer than most.
- **Keep championing the "Mission OS" and Value Stream Mapping.** Watching you dive into Value Stream Mapping was fantastic. You have a strong grasp of where the company is going operationally. Your enthusiasm for these methodologies aligns perfectly with the broader organizational goals, and you are well-positioned to help others understand them.




#### **2. STOP: Acting as a "Scribe" Product Owner & Working in Silos**




- **Stop functioning as a granular Product Owner for technical framework teams.** While your intention to "fill the gap" is appreciated, acting as a PO for a framework service often leads to "talking in circles" or duplicating engineering planning efforts. Your time is too valuable to be spent merely capturing or facilitating logic that the engineers are already defining.  I believe that your talents are wasted there, and would try to find a way to impact the greater PaaS design.  You may already be doing this and I am un aware. 
- **Stop isolating during the work week.** At the Staff level, visibility is currency. When you work solo or disappear to crunch on tasks, we lose the opportunity for organic collaboration. We need to see *how* you are working, not just the result, to ensure our terminologies and efforts aren't drifting apart.  Finding the right balance of heads down deep work as well as being visible / pairing is important. Again I caveat this critique with you may already be doing this with other designers on FORGE.  I do hear you have numerous one on one meetings throughout the week. 




#### **3. START: Force Multiplier Leadership & Action-Over-Explanation**




- **Start acting as a "Force Multiplier" for the Design practice.** Instead of managing the product backlog for one specific team, pivot your focus to enabling *other* designers and engineers. We need you to lead the user experience strategy for the platform and mentor lower-level designers, rather than managing ticket logistics.
- **Start driving execution, not just establishing credibility.** You often explain how you have "done this before" to build trust. Next year, I want you to move faster from explaining your past experience to delegating current action. Make it easier for others to follow your lead by creating frameworks or templates they can use, rather than just explaining the theory.
- **Start applying "Mission OS" to the daily workflow.** You have learned the theory; now be the one to drive its execution across the teams. Help the senior and lower-level designers/engineers fulfill the Mission OS in a tangible way. This is where you can provide unique value that no one else on the engagement can.
