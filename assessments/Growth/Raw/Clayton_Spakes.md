**Comment**:
> I feel like I have continued to grow over the last 6 months since mid-year reviews. I do still have lots of room to grow. Things that I know I need to focus on are giving timely feedback, making sure to complete tasks and not let things drop when things are busy and making sure to give good handoffs to teammates if I am going to be out. I also want to contribute more to growth practices and building our department.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I plan to start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> **Start:** Making sure that I am giving direct feedback to the person (not through Carlo or their Director)
**Stop:** Being reactive to opportunities (reach out earlier, schedule meetings, etc)
**Keep Doing:** Learning and expanding my understanding of the growth role, trying to expand to a new agency

### Question 13
**What are your top three accomplishments and their impact on Rise8’s mission that you want to highlight for the year?**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> 1. Expanded knowledge of Rise8 in IRS, which was a new agency. There is a lot of work that needs to be done to get things on contract, but brand recognition is stronger than before.
2. Refined proposal process by implementing feedback from past opportunities. SPRUCE and others have been a constant learning opportunity and have completely changed the way we approach the proposal process. 
3. Helped the Growth department scale by leading the implementation of AI tools and helping enable other members of the team.

However, for the two activities I worked on with Clayton, I can confidently say I would like to work with him again (rehire). I didn't experience anything that would signal Clayton isn't an A-player at Rise8

**Rating**: 5 - Strongly Agree

**Comment**:
> I would enthusiastically rehire Clayton Spakes because he has been one of the most hardworking, supportive, and enabling partners I have ever worked with. In his role supporting the Growth team, he consistently demonstrates respect for the time and capacity of those he collaborates with, especially when asking for part-time support. He goes out of his way to ensure he is not overburdening others and always brings clarity, context, and thoughtfulness to every request.




Clayton has also been a leader in helping other team members grow, including myself. His presence, communication style, and steady leadership make every interaction more productive and enjoyable. He is an extremely valuable member of the Growth team, and his work ethic and collaborative approach strengthen every initiative he touches.

### Question 12
**For the next year, I would recommend that you start/stop/keep doing the following things:**

**Rating**: None - Unknown

**Comment**:
> ## **Start Doing**
- Being more direct with the support team about his perspective on the client and what to expect. Sharing opinions and context up front will help the team prepare more effectively for proposals, scoping sessions, and early conversations.
## **Stop Doing**
- Leaning too heavily on scripted intros or phrasing during calls. In a few sessions, the openings have felt a bit rehearsed, and bringing a more natural, conversational tone would make his facilitation style feel even stronger.
## **Keep Doing**
- Continuing to be a steady source of support for the team. Clayton consistently takes on tasks that would normally fall to the support team, especially when bandwidth is limited, and this has made a huge difference in our ability to deliver.
- Maintaining his thoughtful, organized approach that makes collaboration smooth and efficient for everyone involved.
