Mission-oriented with a growth mindset!\n\n**Rob Monroe:**\nI truly haven't had many opportunities to work with Clayton in 2025, so I don't believe it's appropriate for me to respond to questions 1-10. However, for the two activities I worked on with Clayton, I can confidently say I would like to work with him again (rehire). I didn't experience anything that would signal Clayton isn't an A-player at Rise8\n\n**Sagar Akre:**\nI would enthusiastically rehire Clayton Spakes because he has been one of the most hardworking, supportive, and enabling partners I have ever worked with. In his role supporting the Growth team, he consistently demonstrates respect for the time and capacity of those he collaborates with, especially when asking for part-time support. He goes out of his way to ensure he is not overburdening others and always brings clarity, context, and thoughtfulness to every request.\n\n\n\n\nClayton has also been a leader in helping other team members grow, including myself. His presence, communication style, and steady leadership make every interaction more productive and enjoyable. He is an extremely valuable member of the Growth team, and his work ethic and collaborative approach strengthen every initiative he touches.\n\n**Ron Golan:**\nIn an effort to balance customer needs with completing a large number of reviews, I am prioritizing written feedback for the people I worked most closely with this year\n",
